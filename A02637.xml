         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Here what ſhould I doo? Many, as I vnderſtand, haue wiſſhed, that I made a ful anſwer to the whole, and to euery parcel of it, and for the better perfourmance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they would allow me a yere, or two more. This deſire requireth M.

With the liues, and manners of the Clergie, I meddle litle. Menne be menne, and wherein they haue donne euil, I accoumpt them worthy of reproufe, no leſſe then he.

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in defence of my ſelfe I haue ſhewed, how vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſclaunderouſly M. Iewel hath burdened me with certaine hateful Crimes in his Epiſtle to the Queenes Maieſtie. The Vntruthe of theſe pointes, I haue thought good plainely to laie before the Readers eies by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the places in my Confutation, whence he tooke the occaſions of his ſclaunders, as he pretendeth by the quotations noted in the Margent.</p>
            <p>

            <pb facs="tcp:12789:6"/>
            <p>Furthermore, bicauſe he woulde the great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Vntruthes, with whiche I charged him, to ſeeme no Vntruthes at al, but that al is the Goſpel, what ſo euer commeth from his Mouthe, and whereas for proufe thereof he hath ſet forth a View of his Vntruthes (the leaſt of al that he could eſpie by me noted againſt him) and pretendeth to iuſtifie the ſame his leaſt Vntruthes in the ſaid View: I haue made an anſwere to that View of Vntruthes, and there doo ſhewe manifeſtly (ſpecially in the chiefe pointes, where errour is moſt perilous) that he was truely, and iuſtly charged with thoſe Vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, and that for ought he hath yet ſaid in Defence of them, he remaineth ſtil chargeable with the ſame, as before. This muche I haue perfourmed in the firſt Booke.</p>
            <p>After this in foure bookes folowing, I detecte his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Lies, Cauilles, ſhiftes, Sclaunders, and ſundrie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true matters, founde in the firſte, and ſeconde parte of his Defence. And in reſpecte thereof, I cal the Treatie, <hi>A Detection of ſundrie foule errours, lies, ſclaunders, &amp;c.</hi> At length hauing tried by very certaine experience, and exacte view of the whole Booke, that there was no ende of lying, what place ſo euer in reading my eie lighted vppon: I thought it moſt profitable, and moſt agreable with my profeſsion, to let paſſe thinges of ſmal importance (the handeling of whiche ſerued him ſpecially to ſcoffe, to vtter vile matter againſte the Churche, and to fil vp his Booke in tended at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be made greate) and to treate of the Articles of Doctrine, in defence of the Truthe, and to confute what he hath brought to the contrarie. Among whiche
<pb facs="tcp:12789:7"/> Articles of doctrine, of ſome I haue treated briefly, as being alreadie treated of in my Confutation, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheres, of ſome at good length, and with more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as of Succeſsion, and of the vnlawful Marriages of Prieſtes, and al other Votaries, wherein he is very large, and copious of Doctours ſayinges of al ſortes, but vtterly deſtitute of any one ſaying, that maketh cleerely for his parte.</p>
            <p>In the ende I doo moſt euidently diſproue and refel what he was hable to bring for Defence of two pointes, which he is not aſhamed to affirme ſeming to me the one very falſe, the other very ſclaunderous. The firſt is, as he auoucheth them, that matters of faith, and Eccleſiaſtical cauſes are to be iudged by the Ciuile Magiſtrate. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that the Papiſtes haue taught, that ſimple Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is no ſinne. How weake proufes he bringeth for the one, and for the other, and yet how ſhameleſly he goeth about to prooue them: by conference of bothe our Treaties it ſhal appeare. Withal, there I haue added a Compariſon of Errours in miſtaking names of menne, bookes, Chapters, &amp;c. with whiche M. Iewel chargeth me, and I him.</p>

Iewel handleth them, in which matters he hath vttered the ſtoare of his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Of theſe I ſaie, I haue ſaid nothing, much diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taging my ſelfe thereby and the common cauſe which I defend, for ſo much as in the making vp of his great Booke with heaping together theſe miniſterly matters, he hath vttered, as he doth euery where els, good ſtoare of moſt euident and groſſe Lies, of which his owne fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and beſt fauourers, in caſe thei were detected, would be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Theſe forenamed be the thinges, which I haue brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, and theſe other, and certaine mo the like, be thoſe, which I haue let paſſe, as being partely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarie,
<pb facs="tcp:12789:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> and vnprofitable, partely vnmeete good houres to be beſtowed about them. By the handeling of theſe the weightier pointes, it wil ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to al menne, with what ſtuffe he filleth his great Bookes, what ſmal credite he deſerueth, how litle pith there is to be found in his multitude of wordes, how litle there is that ſerueth aptly to the purpoſe among the great heapes of teſtimonies, that he laieth together. Surely his Defence being wel examined by any man that hath ſkil, and can iudge of theſe points, it muſt needes be thought, that when he ſaw he had not the plaine truth of his ſide, yet with multitude of allegations he would make a ſhew of learning to the ignorant, and trouble the anſwerer with confuſion. Euen ſo many Barbarous Princes (as we reade in ſtories) when they lacked a conuenient number of good and tried Souldiers, haue gonne about to fraie their enemies with multitude of people, who haue learned by their great ouerthrowes, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times victorie is not obteined by multitude of menne.</p>
            <p>In deede the Truth needeth not ſo many ſayinges pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of Schoolemenne, of Summiſtes, of Gloſes vpon Gratian, and other partes of the Canon Lawe, and out of ſo many Canoniſtes of al ſortes. For trial of a mater to be prooued true, in queſtions touching our beleefe, one ſaying of the Scripture is ſufficient: if the expreſſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture faile vs, twoo, or three Teſtimonies of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers not being contrarie to the reſte, maie ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But ſuche a confuſe, and vnorderly number of ſayinges, ſpecially of ſuche as be not of great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as this man commonly allegeth, of the ſame not one making cleerely for this purpoſe, in moſte matters,
<pb facs="tcp:12789:9"/> what doth it els, but breede a ſuſpicion among the wiſe, that the matter is not true, for proufe whereof they be alleged?</p>
            <p>But by this meane he thought to winne credit at leaſt with the people. For the people that can not iudge of theſe matters, thinketh him beſt learned, that hath moſt woordes. It is knowen, that when they beholde two reaſoning together of any thing, whereof they haue no ſkil, commonly they commend the mainteiner of the worſe cauſe, in caſe he be fuller of wordes, be they neuer ſo litle to the purpoſe, and ſay in his praiſe, that he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the other partie to euery <hi>Quare.</hi> M. Iewel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, and making his moſt accompte of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of them that be vnlearned, to whom he leaneth, and by multitude of whom he, and they of his ſide mind to ſtand (for touching the learned, they ſee they can winne none) beſtoweth great paines, and charges to ſet out great bookes, that at leaſt in the opinion of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and of them that haue not leiſure to examine the points how ſubſtantially they are treated, he maie ſeeme to haue done iolily, and to haue acquited him ſelfe like a great Clerke. In very deede if a man haue care howe muche he maie ſaie, rather then how truly, and feare not to vtter vntruthes: he hath this aduantage ouer his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie defending the truth with a conſcience not to ſwarue from the cenſure of the Church, that he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies finde abundance of matter to vtter. For (as it hath of olde ben ſaid) <hi>Mendacium eſt multiplex, veritas ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,</hi> Lying is manifolde, Truth is ſimple. Lying hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plaites and foldinges, Truth is without plaite or wrinckle. Therefore it is no marueile, if the Treaties of
<pb facs="tcp:12789:9"/> the one be narrowe and ſhorte; of the other wide and long.</p>
            <p>As for me, if I prooue M. Iewel an vntrue man in ſo many pointes, as I haue treated of, I haue donne that, whereby his credite muſt be broken. His credite being broken, what remaineth, but that in this kinde of trade he go for a Banckroute? If he be a Banckrout, worthily is he to be begiled, that truſteth him. Some wil ſay perhaps, it is not likely, I ſhould with ſo ſmal a booke diſcredit him, that hath written ſo much. But it maie pleaſe this man to remember, that, to ſaie the truth, it is not M. Iewel, that hath written muche. He hath taken muche out of other mens bookes: of his owne he hath in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner nothing, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely very litle. So that, peruſe his Booke who wil, he ſhal finde, that he is but a ſeely Tranſlatour of other mens wordes, a heaper together of al Writers ſayings, and that moſt commonly to more oſtentation of tale, then to the making vp of good weight. So that if thinges be brought to an exact trial, he ſhalbe found no diſputer, no reaſoner, no diſcourſer, no Writer, but only a gatherer together of other mennes Sentences. How be it, it is not the huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a booke, that argueth the ſufficiencie of proufes. Truth is content to be ſet foorth with few wordes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet doo I reproue him, for that he allegeth what he findeth in other Writers. For therby we bring credite to doubteful matters. But for that alleging ſo much, he alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſo litle to the purpoſe, yea in manner nothing, and (boldly wil I auouche it) vtterly nothing, for due proufe of any his new and ſtrange doctrines, being contrarie to that of ancient time hath benne beleeued in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Churche. This ſhal ſeeme more probable, if it be
<pb facs="tcp:12789:10"/> confirmed by ſome plaine, and true examples.</p>
            <p>Lette vs then examine M. Iewelles common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour in an example or twoo. To diſcuſſe many, the breuitie of a Preface wil not permitte. O that he were in place to chooſe the example him ſelfe, out of his whole Booke to his beſt aduantage, that ſo it might eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, with what weake tooles he fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth.</p>

Hierome, in reproufe of them that condemned Matrimonie. And yet euen there immediatly after he allegeth them both for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demners of Matrimonie.

There alſo beſide the report of <hi>Aeneas Syluius,</hi> whiche him ſelfe recanted, and of Polydore Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, a man of our time, and in theſe matters of ſmal cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, he ſticketh not to praie helpe of one Fabian, a late ſeely Chronicler of London, and with his woorſhipful teſtimonie forſooth would faine prooue his mater, that is to ſaie, with a maine Lie, that Biſhoppes and Prieſtes lyued a thouſand yeres together with their Wiues, no lawe being to the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Nowe were al theſe thinges true, according to the purporte of M.

For I trow M.

               </note> I referre the Reader vnto the firſt Chapter of the fifth booke of this Treatie. Howſoeuer it be, by this anſwer M. Iewel fleeth from the point, as farre as he fled before. For the Queſtion is, whether Prieſtes in general that haue made a Vowe of Chaſtitie maie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and he anſwereth that Prieſtes of England be not Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. Which anſwer ſerueth as aptly in this caſe, as if a queſtion being demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of him, whether Heretikes are to be burned, he would anſwer, <hi>we the Superintendentes of England, and our Ministers be no heretiques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this he conueigheth him ſelfe to certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places, and bringeth in a Huge number of Doctours ſayinges tending to this meaning in effect, that Chaſtitie is hard to keepe, that it is the gifte of God, that God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it not to al, that it is to be counſelled, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that a man conſider wel of what ſtrength he is, and if he ſee him ſelfe not hable to perfourme the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of Virginitie, that rather then he fal into the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of deadly ſinne, he take a wife, and vſe the remedie ordeined againſt incontinencie. Al which ſayinges (we
<pb facs="tcp:12789:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> graunt) be true, and are to be vnderſtanded of them, whiche be free, and haue not bounde them ſelues by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Vowe to conteine.</p>
            <p>To be ſhorte, it were a very tedious thing here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſe, how he ronneth from Doctour to Doctour, how he craueth ſtuffing of the Canoniſtes, and Schoolemen, whom God wote he litle eſteemeth, how he writeth out their ſentences, and therewith filleth vp his Booke. As for the ancient Doctours ſayinges, that folow after al this, they are ſpoken, ſome againſt the perfourmance of wicked Vowes, ſome ſerue for admonition, that certaine maie be ſuffred to marrie, who hauing made onely a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Vowe, either can not, or wil not conteine, and that the Marriages of ſuche perſonnes ought to ſtand for good, and not to be diſſolued, ſome importe rebuke of filthy life, and exhortation to Chaſtitie, ſome be written againſt them, that either vtterly condemned the ſtate of Matrimonie, or willed Prieſtes, and Deacons in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churche to be compelled to forſake the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their lawful Wiues, whiche they had married be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they receiued holy Orders.</p>
            <p>Thus he writeth out other mennes ſayinges without order, or diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſkippeth from one matter to an other, and emptieth, as it were, the ſtoare of his Notebookes into this Defence, and when he hath ſhuffled in al, he proueth nothing directly, but onely bringeth the Reader to a Confuſion, and commeth not at al to the diſcuſsion of the point, that we ſtaie vpon, whiche in this matter of Prieſtes Marriages is, that to marrie it is not lawful after deliberate Vowe of chaſtitie made, nor after holy Orders receiued. What colourable argumentes, or
<pb facs="tcp:12789:12"/> teſtimonies he bringeth to proue the affirmatiue,<note place="margin">Infrà lib. <hi>5</hi> Cap. <hi>2</hi>
               </note> in this Treatie Reader thou ſhalt ſee them cleerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe (to ſhew thee an other example) hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon him to proue,<note place="margin">Defence. Pag. 157.</note> that the Canoniſtes haue taught the people, that Fornication betwen ſingle folke is no ſinne, it is a worlde to ſee what a doo he maketh, what a number of Allegations he hudleth together, and when he hath vttered al his ſtoare, he is as farre from proufe of that he tooke in hand to proue, as he was before he beganne. So that in effecte nothing thereby is done, but onely malice ſhewed, and incke and paper ſpent.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to make a great ſhewe,<note place="margin">Defence. 360.</note> and to increaſe his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume (for to what other purpoſe I ſee not) he telleth vs of certaine beaſtly ſayinges of <hi>Aetius</hi> the olde Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, and of <hi>Prodicus</hi> the heathen philoſopher, as though the Canoniſtes were to be blamed for the faultes of the Heretiques, and Infidelles of olde time. Nexte, he bringeth in Laurentius Valla the Grammarian, whoſe ſaying, though it be not needeful here to reherſe for the reuerence of chaſte eares, yet it maie with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient interpretation be honeſtly defended. Then <hi>Richardus de Sancto Victore</hi> a late Schooleman, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates the Hiſtoriographer are haled in to geue their verdite, and though they tel vs of the corrupte iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certaine, that made litle accompte in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Fornication and whooredome: yet that the Popes Canoniſtes taught the people, that ſimple For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is no ſinne, thereof they ſpeake not one word. Which bicauſe M. Iewel him ſelfe perceiued right wel, he preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that he feared would be obiected, and after
<pb facs="tcp:12789:13"/> that number of impertinent allegations,<note place="margin">M. Ievv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles But.</note> commeth in, as his manner is, with his But, ſaying, <hi>But ye wil ſaie, al this hitherto perteineth nothing vnto the Canoniſtes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom anſwere maie be returned, that ſo it is in deed: and whereas he knew it him ſelfe, what meant he neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe to put it in, but to increaſe the heape of his Volume?</p>
            <p>After this he pretendeth to come to the very point, and to hit the naile on the head, as they ſaie. And there he taketh aduantage of a Decree of the firſt Toletane Councel falſly reported in Gratian by the ouerſight of the printer in an olde Copie, many other Copies being true, whiche aduantage neuertheleſſe eftſones there he forgoeth, confeſsing the Copie to be falſe. Yet al muſt in, to fil vp the great booke. Then he goeth to the true Copie, and either by ignorance he miſtaketh the place, or by malice falſifieth the ſenſe, diſſembling, that the worde <hi>Concubina</hi>
               <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubina.</note> is oftentimes taken in good parte, to witte, for a woman vſed in al reſpectes like a Wife, and with the intent, and affection of wedlocke, before the Marriage be openly ſolemnized. This ſhal be better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by reading that I haue ſaid hereof <hi>Lib. 5. cap. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From that Councel (whiche was holden long before any of the Canoniſtes, whom ſo fowly he ſclaundereth, wrote letter) he goeth to peake in his Gloſes, the Gloſes I meane vpon <hi>Otho</hi> (whom like an vnſkilful lawier, he maketh one with <hi>Otho bonus</hi>) and vpon the Decrees of Gratian. The one Gloſelie falſifieth by leauing out a worde of chiefe importance, the other of purpoſe he miſconſtrueth, the reſt that he allegeth out of an other Gloſe, and out of one Petrus Rauennas a Canoniſte, is
<pb facs="tcp:12789:13"/> true, and perteineth nothing to the wicked doctrine, whereof he accuſeth the Canoniſtes.</p>
            <p>From the Gloſes he ſtarteth to S. Auguſtine <hi>in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridio ad Laurentium.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Defence 361.</note> And out of him he taketh a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, vtterly to no purpoſe, but to fil vp the paper. From S. Auguſtine to the Councel of Baſile, then to Eraſmus <hi>in Enchiridio militis Christiani,</hi> belying them bothe. From Eraſmus he crepeth to <hi>Iacobus de Valentia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iacob. de Valentia in Pſal. <hi>118</hi>
               </note> ſaying of Iewes, Saracenes, and certaine il Chriſtian menne, that <hi>to excuſe their deteſtable life, they affirme ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Fornication to be lawful.</hi> But what is this to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſtes? From this <hi>Iacobus</hi> the Spaniard of <hi>Valentia,</hi> he conueieth him ſelfe to <hi>Alexander</hi> of Hales the Engliſh man, and from him to <hi>Antonius</hi> of Florence the Italian. But at their handes he findeth no more reliefe, then he founde at the others. By <hi>Antonius</hi> it is roported onely, that <hi>their errour is confuted, who ſaie, that ſimple Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no ſinne.</hi> In <hi>Alexander</hi> there is nothing founde, but onely a ſaying pretended to be S. Ambroſes, whiche maketh nothing to the purpoſe, neither is it at al being vttered in ſuche wordes, to be found in S. Ambroſe.</p>
            <p>At length he endeth this matter with a falſified ſaying of S. Auguſtine, making that holy Father (as vntruly he reporteth his tale) to ſaie, <hi>that he can not tel, whether that kinde of Fornication, whiche ſingle menne committe with ſingle womenne, be forbidden, or no.</hi> Whiche, were it true that S. Auguſtine ſo ſaid, as in deede he ſaith it not, but ſpeaketh otherwiſe, as here the reader ſhal finde by me declared, yet by that, the ſclaunder vttered againſt the Canoniſtes, is not iuſtified.</p>
            <p>This muche haue I here noted for examples ſake, to
<pb facs="tcp:12789:14"/> the intent thou maiſt vnderſtand Reader, what order he keepeth commonly in his writing, and whereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that his bookes riſe to ſuche a huge quantitie.</p>
            <p>And as he hath donne in theſe two matters, ſo hath he donne in the reſte, very fewe excepted. The ſame would I here by ſundrie other mo euident examples ſhewe, were it not ouer long.</p>
            <p>Certainely this is not to anſwer a Booke, it is not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly to replie, it is not directly to confute a Booke. It is onely an oſtentation of much reading, it is a copying out of common places laid vp in Notebookes, it is to render wordes for reaſons, and heapes of impertinent ſentences of what ſo euer Writers, for apte teſtimonies of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers. Briefly, it is not an orderly diſproufe of the doctrine that the Church hath hitherto holden. For who ſo wil conſider of it with right iudgement, ſhal finde our proufes to ſtande vnſhaken, and my former Booke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a ſufficient Confutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not only of the Apologie, but alſo of the pretenſed Defence it ſelfe. That it maie truly be ſaid, there was a Confutation of the Defence made, before the Defence it ſelfe was printed. For if the pointes of my former Booke be wel weighed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of, they wil to the learned ſeeme a ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what ſo euer he bringeth.</p>
            <p>For trial hereof I referre me to the anſwere, whiche here I haue made vnto his View of Vntruthes.<note place="margin">The View of M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvels Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes.</note> Among whiche Vntruthes thou ſhalt finde few noted out of the Apologie ſo by him diſcharged, but that in reſpect of my Confutation, notwithſtanding his Defence, he maie ſeeme ſtil to ſtand chargeable no leſſe then before. If he can no better diſcharge him ſelfe of ſuche Vntruthes,
<pb facs="tcp:12789:14"/> which he him ſelfe hath choſen out of the whole heape, as the leaſt, and eaſieſt for him to defende, and in iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of which he had greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence: it maie ſoone be iudged, how vnlike it is, that he ſhalbe hable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him ſelfe of thoſe others, whiche he thought beſt to conceele and diſſemble.</p>
            <p>One thing good Reader it behoueth thee much to be warned of, in caſe thou deſire to ſtande an vpright vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere betwen M. Iewel and me. Vpon what places ſo euer thou ſhalt happen to light, in which he ſhal ſeeme to haue any good aduantage againſt me, or againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Catholique Churche, paſſe not them ouer lightly, weigh wel both our groundes, examine both our allegations, truſte not to ought, that is laid forth by either of vs preſently, but reſort to the Bookes, whence euery thing is taken.

            </p>
            <p>By this ſentence, as it is here ſet forth, S. Auguſtine is ſet to ſchoole, and made to confeſſe (whiche he would neuer haue confeſſed whiles he liued) that he could not tel, whether Fornication that is committed betwene ſingle folcke, were forbidden, or no: whereby he ſhould ſeeme to geue great libertie to ſingle perſonnes to folow the filthy luſtes of their fleſh. And here, which is to be noted, whereas the reſte of the ſentence is printed in the ſmal letter, in which the Doctours teſtimonies be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſet out, theſe wordes in Latine, <hi>Fornicatio, an prohibita inueniri poſsit, ignoro,</hi> and theſe Engliſh wordes, <hi>Fornication, whether it be forbidden, or no, I can not tel,</hi> are printed in a farre greater letter, that they ſhould rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily appeare to the eie, and be readde of al menne, as if he were deſirous, as the Deuil him ſelfe is, that al were perſuaded, that Fornication among ſingle perſons were no ſinne. Which doctrine there, and in certaine other
<pb facs="tcp:12789:18"/> places of that Booke, by ſundrie colourable ſayinges of Writers he ſeemeth to labour to perſuade.</p>
            <p>But the true ſaying of S. Auguſtine, and the meaning of the ſame, is farre otherwiſe. For thus he ſaith, not in <hi>Quaeſt. in Exod. quaeſt.</hi> 20. as the place by M. Iewel is falſly quoted: but in <hi>Quaeſtionum ſuper Exodum lib. 2. quaeſt. 71. Sed ſi non omnis Fornicatio etiam Moechia dici potest, vbi ſit in Decalogo prohibita illa fornicatio, quam faciunt viri qui vxores non habent, cum foeminis, quae maritos non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, vtrum inueniri poſsit, ignoro.</hi> As muche to ſaie, But if it be ſo, that al Fornication maie not be called alſo <hi>(Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia)</hi> Aduouterie, where that Fornication, which menne commit that haue no wiues, with womenne that haue no huſbandes, is forbidden in the Table of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, whether it maie be founde, or no, I can not tel.</p>
            <p>S. Auguſtine ſaith not ſimply, he knew not whether ſimple Fornication were forbidden, or no: he knewe wel, it was forbidden: But if it were once denied, that al Fornication were ſignified by the woorde and name of <hi>Moechia,</hi> (whiche properly is Aduouterie, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de is expreſſed in the ten Commaundementes) the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie whereof he prooueth in that place very learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: in this caſe, and not otherwiſe, he acknowlegeth him ſelfe not to knowe, where the Fornication, that is committed betwen ſingle perſonnes, maie be found for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden (where? not generally, but) <hi>in Decalogo,</hi> in the ten Commaundementes. And this is the only point, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in S. Auguſtine confeſſeth his ignorance. Howbeit in the ſame place he ſheweth, that vnder the name of <hi>Moechia,</hi> al manner Fornication is compriſed, and that therefore

            <p>Thus Reader by Viewe of theſe fewe places noted out of the whole heape, thou maiſt conceiue, with
<pb facs="tcp:12789:20"/> what manner ſtuffe M. Iewel hath filled vp that huge Booke. Suche as theſe are, after the ſame rate the more parte of the reſte is. Wherefore al menne maie ſee, how good cauſe they haue to hier their Promotours, and Waiters, to lie in waite for our Bookes at the Portes, and Creekes, and with great extremitie to pouniſh al menne, who are founde to haue them. For by that meane they hope to winne a long time, before their guile and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode be made open to al the worlde.</p>
            <p>Seeing then among al that huge heape ſo litle can be founde, whereby he maie ſeeme to go directly to the pointes that be in Controuerſie, and preſently treated of, ſeeing where he geueth out certaine ſhadowes, as it were of proufes, if the ſame be duely examined, they be tried corrupted, and falſified by one vntrue meane or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeeing the confutation of al that is to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, muſt be made by repeating and laying forth againe the teſtimonies truly, whiche he allegeth falſly, by ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, where he clippeth of the Doctours wordes, where he addeth wordes of his owne, where he leaueth out the beginning, or the ende of Sentences, where he vſeth falſe tranſlation, where he conceeleth and diſſembleth the Circumſtance of the places, and foloweth the bare ſounde of wordes without farther view of the Writers intent, where he maketh falſe exchange of wordes, as he is now taken in the manner, changing <hi>Blame,</hi> a worde of chaſte meaning, into <hi>Handle</hi> a worde of vnchaſte ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: ſeing I ſaie, this is the meane and waie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Confutation of the pretenſed Defence muſt be wrought: I leaue vnto the iudgement of thoſe who can iudge of theſe thinges, what a long and tedious worke
<pb facs="tcp:12789:21"/> it would be, and how litle profite would redounde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if I ſhould refute his whole Booke.</p>
            <p>This being wel conſidered, ſpecially whereas alſo a long time is required to the finiſhing of ſuche a worke, great charges are to be emploied in printing, and menne at theſe daies ſoone waxe wearie, and feele lothſomnes in reading long Treaties: I thought I ſhould doo more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently, if I confuted the chiefe pointes of Doctrine, then if I beſtowed my labour about the confutation of the whole, whiche for the moſt parte conſiſteth of light and vaine trifles not worth the reading. And to ſaie the truthe, what credite is he worthy to beare in the reſte, that in the chiefe pointes is proued to haue dealte ſo vntruly?</p>
            <p>If I truly charge M. Iewel with thertie, fortie, fiftie, yea with a hundred great and notorious Lies, and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confute the ſame, ſhal I not ſeeme to haue proued him a Lier, and a falſe dealer in theſe cauſes, excepted I confute him in a thouſand, eleuen, or twelue hundred mo? If the caſe be ſo, then is the aduantage in the multitude of Lies, and he is fartheſt from being confuted, who maketh moſt Lies, and ſpecially he that maketh ſo many, as the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the truth ſhal not haue leiſure to trie them Lies. It is wel knowen, how muche eaſier it is to write Lies, then to confute Lies. A Lie is vttered in a worde or two: the poiſon of an hainous Hereſie is ſpet forth in a line or two: Nor this, nor that perhappes can wel and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be confuted, ſo as it be made plaine vnto the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in foure or fiue leaues.</p>
            <p>Leaſt I ſhould ſeeme to ſaie nothing in his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb facs="tcp:12789:21"/> and not to acknowlege his worthieſt qualities, I graunt, he is furniſhed with Rhetorie, with humaine let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with Eloquence, with a mearie wit, and that he hath a readie grace in ſkoffing, yea that he is hable to greeue the harte not onely of his Aduerſarie, but alſo of any other godly man, with ſcorneful flowtes in thinges of greateſt holineſſe. But Chriſtian Reader, we ſtriue not for the Garland of that game: we go not about to trie maiſteries of ſuche witte, or of humaine learning. Our ſtrife is about the Truthe. The waie to ſhewe it, and proue it, (whiche he him ſelfe by open Chalenge hath offred his Doctrine to be tried by) is by laying forth the plaine Scriptures, the examples of the Primitiue Church, the teſtimonies of the General Councelles, and ancient Fathers.</p>
            <p>Of theſe who hath ſo great ſtoare, ſaith a frende of his, as M. Iewel? Who euer ſawe the margent of any Booke ſo beſet with cotations, as his Bookes are? This were a great euidence of the Truthe on his ſide, if the matter were alwaies tried by what ſo euer multitude of writers ſayinges. But what if the number of his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies be quite beſide the purpoſe? Seemeth he not then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhameleſſe? Is he not then farre to blame ſo to abuſe the plaine and wel meaning Readers? It ſhalbe ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes in his excuſe: He ſeeth the negligence of menne, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that fewe, or none examine our writinges. And therefore he thinketh, he ſhal ſeeme to ſaie muche, though in deede nothing be ſaid, that perteineth to the pointes preſently handled. And where a thing is to be done and the ſame for want of habilitie can not be done: there it ſeemeth good policie to geue the aſſaie, and
<pb facs="tcp:12789:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> to make ſhewe, as if it could be donne, or were donne. It is knowen, how flatterers make reſemblance of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how Hypocrites geue forthe tokens of holineſſe, the intended Bankroute of good truſte and credite, the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Coward of ſtoute courage, Beggers oftentimes of welth, Queanes of womanly honeſtie, and chaſt demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Right ſo M.

            <p>Touching the life of the Clergie, wel maie I confeſſe, that M. Iewel hath ſomewhat to ſaie, out of certaine writers, how true, I knowe not: whereto I ſhal hardly be hable to make anſwer in ful defence of certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnes. But as touching the Doctrine, that the Catholike Churche holdeth at this daie, and hath alwaies holden, I auouche boldly, as by ſundrie our bookes it hath now ben clearely proued, and they vnderſtand ſo much that doo thoroughly examine the reaſons, authorities, and proufes of both partes: that he is not hable to bring ſo muche as one ſentence out of any allowed writer, that may not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be refelled.</p>
            <p>And bicauſe he knoweth, that in pointes of Doctrine the force of Truth is clearely on our ſide, he would faine

As for example, what cracke is there made in the Doctrine of the Catholique Churche, if the <hi>Nominales,</hi> and the <hi>Reales,</hi> if the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtes,</hi> and <hi>Scotiſtes</hi> diſſent about pointes Logical, or Metaphyſical, or perhappes alſo about the paringes of ſome Scholaſtical pointes of Diuinitie? What if ſome light beleeuing writers haue ſadly and in erneſt made mention of one Ioane a woman Pope, deceiued by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Polonus<note place="margin">Martinus Polonus.</note> a man of ſmal credite, who moued with olde wiues tales firſt committed that fable to writing?

What if Petrus Aloiſius, whom Paulus Tertius the Pope loued ſo tenderly, were a vicious man? What if Iohn Diazius the Spaniard were vnnaturally murdered by Alphonſus Diazius his brother that liued at Rome?</p>
            <p>What if Luther, wrote againſt the furious vproares of the Boures in Germanie, when he ſawe they were

What if ſome haue written, though not without contradiction of others, that Poiſon was miniſtred in the bleſſed Sacrament? What if a Pope ſhewed him ſelfe cruel, and without pitie, in ſuffering Frances Dandulus the Venetians Ambaſſadour to lie vnder his table like a dogge, whiles he was at diner.</p>
            <p>What if Popes haue ſuffered great Princes and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narkes to kiſſe their feete, to holde their Stiroppes, to leade their horſes by the Bridle? W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What if I ſaie, al theſe, and many other ſuche thinges were graunted, of whiche we are perſuaded, that ſome are true, the more parte is falſe, muche is ſo written, as it maie be defended, no leſſe then impugned?

Muſt this now needes be made a good Argument, Some of their liues were ſinneful, Ergo, their Doctrine was falſe?</p>
            <p>Truely theſe be the matters, with the enlarging where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Defence hath riſen to ſo huge a quantitie.

            <p>Wherefore ſeing the farre greater parte of M.

            <p>I ſaie not, but he maie do eftſones, as he hath twiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready donne, that is to ſaie, gather together a huge num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſayinges out of al ſortes of Writers, and printing this Treatie withal, ſende vs forth an other great booke, conteining much ſtuffe to litle purpoſe, and not once tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the very preciſe pointes, wherein he is charged with foule errours, and falſhed. But to come directly to the pointes by me thoroughly refelled, and with good proufes to iuſtifie the ſame, keeping him ſelfe in from idle ranging abroad in matters not denied, or otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent: this is that I affirme, he ſhal neuer be hable to perfourme, though he write againe as muche as Foxe hath raked together into that Donghil of his ſtincking Martyrs.</p>

            <p>In ſundrie other pointes alſo, whiche depende of Doctrine, I haue detected his great and manifolde Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes.

By the Premiſſes of theſe mennes Doctrines, we haue iuſte cauſe to thinke, that at length they wil teache, that the very Signes them ſelues alſo for auoiding ſuperſtition maie ſurceaſſe, and be put awaie, where the thing ſignified is perfourmed, and ſufficiently beleeued. And ſo is Baptiſme like to be quite aboliſhed with other Signes, and Ceremonies.

                  <p>Concerning that ye ſay of king Philip ſurnamed Le Bel, if we may beleeue <hi>Paulus AEmylius</hi> the beſt writer of the Frenche Chronicles, the cauſe was ſuch betwene Pope <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> and that King, that if he did not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him, but alſo offered gifte of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to <hi>Albert</hi> the Emperour, as <hi>Platina</hi> your Author herein writeth: he may ſeeme therein to haue done not altogether ſo euil, as ye pretende. <q>For as bothe <hi>AEmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and Platina do witneſſe, the cauſe of their falling out was, that, whereas the Pope being firſt ſued vnto by <hi>Caſſanus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Caſſanus.</note> a Chriſtian Prince, and a great Conquerour in the Eaſt, to ioyne with him for the recouerie of the holy land, ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Apamea</hi> to the Frenche King for his neceſſarie aide in that ſo common a quarel of al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome: he being offended, either that the ſute was not firſt made to him, either for that the ſaid Biſhop had done his Ambaſſade with ſhewe of more auctoritie, then
<pb facs="tcp:12789:41"/> the King thought it became him, or vpon ſome other priuate grudge: did not only vtterly refuſe to ſende any helpe toward the voyage, but alſo contemptuouſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide common order, and cruelly, committed the Popes legate to priſon, and there kept him, vntil ſuch time, as through the Popes Interdict, the King was compelled to ſet him at libertie. Now of geuing awaie his kingdome, this chiefe French Hiſtoriographer maketh no mention. And if the Pope ſo did, why may he not ſeeme to haue done it rather to feare him, and to reclaime his mind from diſobedience? Verely <hi>Platina</hi> writing it declareth, how before the Pope proceded to that extremitie, the French King did, what in him laye, to withdrawe the people of Fraunce from the obedience of the Churche, and See Apoſtolike. Al theſe thinges with eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudgement weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Pope ſeemeth not ſo much worthy of the blame, which by your maligne reporte ye charge him with, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the occaſion being firſt geuen of the Kinges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful demeanour. But what ſo euer may be iudged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yea though the Pope therein be without al excuſe, what is that to you? How ſerueth it you to any colour of excuſe of your Schiſme, and cutting of your ſelues from the reſt of Chriſtendome Chriſtes myſtical bodie?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus there. And whereas M. Iewel maketh ſo much adoo about that, whiche in deed I ſaid not, but whiche he vntruly beareth the Reader in hand, I ſay, that is, that yf the Pope gaue away the kingdome of France from the Prince, he did it to thintent to fray him, whereat he ieaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the Defence, ſaying, <hi>A prety deuiſe, to fraie a king, to pulle the Crowne Emperial from his head:</hi> to this I anſwere. I ſpake it not abſolutely, but aſked, why, if the Pope ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12789:41"/> did, the caſe being wel weighed, he might not ſeeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue done it to fraie him, and to reclaime his minde from diſobedience, as by the euent it was ſhewed, that ſo he did.</p>
                  <p>For the Frenche King returning to obedience, and being reconciled, kepte ſtil the crowne, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that gifte. And when ſo euer any Prince at other times reuoked his euil purpoſe, and confourmed him ſelfe to right, ſuch giftes of titles were alſo eftſones by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes reuoked.

Whiche parte denie you? That Goddes Vengeance lighted vpon him? Or that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is like? For proufe of the Vengeance, ye haue the plaine Scripture. 2.

                  <p>Touching the Preſumption, it is like. For in bothe it is

And what is that which Biſhoppes, and Prieſtes maie doo, whiche ye haue not by your Acte of Parlament geuen the Quene auctoritie to do? What power, or auctoritie is excepted, where al thinges, and cauſes be expreſſed, where I ſaie, by ſolemne othe taken before God and his holy Angelles, ye binde men to acknowledge her for the chiefe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head (for by your new worde, <hi>Gouernoure,</hi> ye take not awaie I trowe the meaning of your former worde <hi>Head) in al thinges and cauſes, as wel ſpiritual, as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral?</hi> Ye know, ye know M.

                  <p>Although the Queene that now is, haue no great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite in the exerciſe of al manner ſuche auctoritie, as ye haue put her in, yet what if after her time, there come in her place an other Prince, King, or Queene, of an other manner courage, and fanſie, whom it ſhal like wel ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for his pleaſure, ſtrange deuotion, ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or pride, to doo the office, which by lawe of your Parlament is committed vnto him,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Par.</hi> 26.</note> as it is written of king <hi>Ozias,</hi> that, <hi>when he became mightie, and of great power, his harte was lifted vp,</hi> and he would needes doo that, whiche belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged onely to the Prieſtes office? If it ſhal like ſuche a Prince, be he your Soueraine Lorde, or Soueraine Ladie, to go into your Pulpites, and there after your manner to raue, and raile at the Pope, at the Papiſtes, and to tel the

                     <hi>and Biſhops were neuer ſo earneſtly bent againſt it.</hi> And yet he ſaith further (whereat I marueil) that <hi>Statutes ſo paſsing onely by the voices of the Lordes Temporal, though the Lordes Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſſente neuer ſo muche, haue neuertheleſſe alwaies ben confirmed, enacted, and publiſhed vnder the names of the Lordes Spiritual, and Temporal.</hi> If it be ſo, then I perceiue, it faieth with the lordes Spiritual, as it faieth with me. For as M.

                  <p>What this is to be called in the Statutes of the Realme, I knowe not, but in the writinges of priuate menne, ſuche as Maiſter Iewels, and myne are, this practiſe of

                  <p>He referreth me for further proufe of this matter to the Recordes of a Parlament, holden by king Edward the firſt at S. Edmundes Burie, <hi>the Archebiſhoppes, and Biſhopes being</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>quite ſhutte forthe,</hi>

And faine would I know of the wiſe and learned in deede, whether al theſe thinges be true, or other wiſe. Verely for my parte I haue great cauſe to doubte. If an other man had ſaid them, I ſhould rather haue beleeued them: As for M.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12789:48"/> where, when ſo euer I lacke the bookes, from whence he bringeth his allegations. And although al that here he reporteth touching this matter, were truely reported, yet thereby it is not proued, that al was lawfully, and wel done. But hereof, as I ſaid before, I refuſe to entre diſpute.</p>
                  <p>But now whereas M. Iewel committeth Religion, and al matters touching Faith, vnto the Lordes Temporal, and Commons aſſembled in Parlamente, and wil that al orders and Statutes by them made and enacted concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame, ſtand for good and lawful, though the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes diſſent neuer ſo muche: By this he maketh the Faith, not a Standerd to meaſure our opinions, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes by, as it ought to be, but he maketh the willes and fanſies of the Lordes, the Standerd, whereby to meaſure our Faith.<note place="margin">Faith made cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For whereas al menne know, in how fewe thinges the Lordes diſſent from the wil and pleaſure of the Prince: who ſeeth not, how thus it maie come to paſſe, that our Religion, and Faith ſhal change at the pleaſure of euery Prince for the time being, and that ſo at length we ſhal haue no ſtable Religion, nor Faith at al? If M.

Iewel is, who ſhal eaſily perſuade the people, that to be the meaning of Goddes worde, by which the Princes, and Lordes maie acheeue their deſires?

                  <pb facs="tcp:12789:49"/>
                  <p>Now whereas he complaineth ſo greuouſly of me, for that I cal their Church, I meane them that made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, and their fauourers, <hi>a malignant Churche, a new Churche erected by the Deuil, a Babilonical Tower, a heard of Antichriste, a Temple of Lucifer, a Synagoge, a Schoole of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ful of Robberie, Sacrilege, Schiſme, and Hereſie:</hi> If he, his felowes, and their folowers wil repent them hartily, and vnfeinedly of their errours, and hereſies, and returne home againe vnto the Catholique Churche: if they wil ceaſſe to diuide, and ſcatter abroad with the deuil the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of diuiſion, and gather together with Chriſte, and repaire vnitie: if they wil leaue the manifolde, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde confuſion of opinions and doctrines, whiche their ſundrie ſectes doo profeſſe, and mainteine ſtubbornly: if they wil leaue to prepare a waie for Antichriſte, by their euil doctrine leading the worlde to al libertie of the fleſh: if they wil cal to God for grace, and diſpoſe them ſelues to humilitie: if they wil at length heare the Catholique Churche, if they wil acknowledge their wicked doctrine againſt the daily Sacrifice, to procede out of Satans Schoole, as it is confeſſed by Luther him ſelfe: if they wil not mainteine their Robberies, and Spoiles of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as iuſte deedes: if they wil forſake their Inceſtuous, and Sacrilegious Marriages: Briefly if they wil amende wherein they haue offended: I wil gladly reuoke thoſe wordes, and how ſo euer in reſpecte of time paſt, they haue deſerued ſo to be ſpoken of, I wil ſpeake of them no other wiſe, then of the Children of the Churche, then of our dere brethren, then of Goddes frendes.</p>
                  <p>Thus I haue anſwered the chiefe partes of M. Iewels epiſtle to the Quenes Maieſtie, and by repeating myne

                  <p>Neither hath he vſed any more truthe in his <hi>Preface to the Chriſtian Reader,</hi> and in his Epiſtle to me ſet at the ende of his Defence: where he filleth his magent with great numbers of Quotations, pretending thereby the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde, and vntrue pointes in the Texte reproued to be founde in the Treaties, whiche ſo buſily he quoteth. Now if I ſhould in likewiſe anſwer to euery ſuche parte in the ſaid Preface, and Epiſtle conteined, by theſe fewe it maie appeare, to what hugeneſſe my booke would growe, and of the whole what vnprofitable matter would riſe, ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none other, but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual and lothſome declaration of his vntrue dealing in one ſorte or other. But for ſo much as the ſame is by this briefe Anſwer to his Epiſtle dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie alreadie ſufficiently diſcouered: that other labour maie ſeeme needeleſſe. As we finde him in this, ſo we finde him in the reſt, though otherwiſe not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, yet in the rate of his writing one manner a man, that is to ſaie, one, that euery where maketh his onely aduantage of lyes, falſifyinges, and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions.</p>

               <p>GEntle Reader, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider I pray thee indifferently, how the caſe ſtandeth betwixt M. Iewel and me. Before he entreth into his Defence of the Apologie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen his Epiſtle to the Quenes Maieſtie, and his Preface to the Reader, he hath extraordinarily inſerted foure leaues. In which he laboureth al that he can, to perfourme two thinges, to diſcredit me, and to aduaunce his owne credit. To bring this to paſſe, Firſt, he accuſeth me, next, he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him ſelfe. He accuſeth me of vncourteous Wordes, he excuſeth him ſelfe, of fowle Vntruthes, ſetting forth a colourable Viewe of a few of the ſame. How reaſonably he doth the one, and how ſufficiently the other: by that I ſhal here declare, thou maiſt iudge.</p>
               <p>Firſt, touching wordes, Where ſo euer godly zeale, and iuſte griefe moued me to vſe ſharpe ſpeache, albeit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where I vſe ſo ſharpe, as the indignite of the thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: of al thoſe places he hath cauſed certaine my wordes to be culled out, and to be laid together, as it were in a table before the Reader. And bicauſe he would not ſeme ſcorneful, euen there reprouing me for the ſame, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them forſooth, <hi>certaine principal flowers of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges modeſt ſpeache.</hi> And leaſt he ſhould at any time leaue his common cuſtome of falſifying al that he taketh in hande, euen here alſo he playeth that parte as kindely, as any where elles. For although ſome ſuche wordes or,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12789:50"/> the like be in deede founde in my writinges againſt him, yet they beare not ſuche an owgly and lothſom viſard, as he putteth on them. As for example, whereas ſometimes for good cauſe I can not finde in my harte, to cal theſe mennes raſh Innouation of the auncient religion, their wicked abrogation of certaine Sacramentes, their vile prophanation of the reſte, their horrible contempte of the body and bloude of Chriſte in the moſt bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Aulter, whereas I ſay, I can not finde in my harte to cal theſe thinges, Godly procedinges, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Goſpel, the ſincere Worde, the right Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Lordes Supper, as they would al men to cal them, but contrarywiſe Deuiliſh ſpite, wickednes, and villanie: to cauſe the mater to ſeme more odious, he reporteth my wordes thus, <hi>your Deuiliſh ſpite, your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiliſh wickednes, your Deuiliſh villanie, &amp;c:</hi> as thoughe I had ſpoken them to him, and to his felowes ſpecially, whereas for the more part ſuche wordes are ſpoken (not in the ſecond, but in the third perſon) of the Heretikes of our time indefinitely, and in general. Whiche neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe if I had ſpoken vnto him, and them directly, it had ben no greeuous ſinne, their deſert conſidered.</p>
               <p>For therein had I folowed the counſel, whiche S. Antonie that bleſſed man gaue vnto his Scholers a litle before he departed this life. To whom he ſaid thus, as S. Athanaſius, who wrote his life, reporteth.<note place="margin">Athanaſ. in vita Antonij.</note>

                  <p>Wordes conſidered alone without compoſition, ſounde good, or euil, according to their ſignification: and al manner of wordes may be vſed without blame. Of the ſentences, and whole ſayinges onely, where the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may be conſidered and weighed, faire, or fowle ſpeache is conceiued. Now if thou wilt take the paines Reader, to turne to the places of my bookes, whence M. Iewel hath piked out thoſe wordes, for vſe of whiche he reproueth me, as a man of vncourteous vtterance: thou ſhalt right wel perceiue (in caſe hereſie haue not vtterly bewitched thyne vnderſtanding, and bereued thee of al iudgement) the verdure of my ſpeache to be ſuche, as may ſeme conuenient for a veſſel of the holy Ghoſte to taſte of.</p>
                  <p>It may pleaſe M. Iewel to conſider, that by degree of Schoole, and by lawful calling otherwiſe, I ſtand in the place of teachers. And therefore though at this preſent the Pulpite be denyed me, yet I find not my ſelfe wholly ſo diſcharged of the office of teaching. Now hauing no other conuenient meane to teache, but by writing: what
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12789:52"/> ought I at this tyme to write rather, then Confutations of his, and his felowes falſe doctrine, and Defences of the Catholique Faith? Whereas this muche I could not do, but that it behoued me to deale with him, who aboue al others moſt buſily impugneth Gods truth, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with thoſe of his ſide: I thought it not good, for ryuing of harde blockes, to vſe ſofte wedges.</p>
                  <p>And though I had litle hope by any way to ryue a ſunder the harde knotte, wherein their hartes, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie are faſte growen together: yet that ſome others by them enuegled might be brought to a better minde, who not being ſo deſperate, be neuertheleſſe hardly withdrawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their errours, by reaſon of long cuſtom, and carnal libertie by the ſame mainteined: I iudged the ſtile and order of writi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, that I haue vſed, to be moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for their behalfe. For they ſeing the Captaines of deceiuers ſo with iuſte ſharpnes rebuked, and their Hereſies with deepe ſtrokes ſo deadly wounded, wil the rather be induced to abhorre their former errours, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke themſelues, and by their reproufe, learne to amend their owne faultes as oftentimes young Princes, and noble children be corrected, with beholding correction miniſtred to other children of baſer condicion.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, if al ſhould be accompted to vſe vnciuile, and vncourteous ſpeache, out of whoſe writinges ſuch wordes may be gathered, as M. Iewel reproueth in me: I knowe not, what Doctor, what Father my eſcape that reproche. Neither S. Cyprian wrote al thinges ſo Martyrlike, nor S. Baſil ſo meekely, nor S. Ambroſe ſo grauely, nor S. Chryſoſtom ſo ſweetly, nor S. Auguſtine ſo temperately, nor S. Gregorie ſo humbly: but with
<pb facs="tcp:12789:53"/> ſearche, no ſmal multitude of ſuche wordes might eaſily be founde in their learned and godly workes, with no leſſe vehemencie of ſpirite vttered againſt Heretiques, and other wicked perſons. What ſhal I ſay of S. Hierom, whoſe vtterance againſt Heretiques of leſſe malice, and againſt other men of more honeſtie, then theſe men are of, is ſuch, that to many he ſeemeth to thunder, and to lighten, rather then to ſpeake?</p>
                  <p>But what ſpeake I of men? I reporte me to thoſe that haue peruſed the bookes of the olde, and newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether the like tokens of erneſt zeale, and iuſte griefe, be not oftentimes founde in the Prophetes, and the Apoſtles them ſelues, who were the Secretaries of the holy Ghoſte.</p>

                  <p>If to eſchew the reproche of ſo wicked a blaſphemie, ye graunt the continuance of your Churche, ye muſt tel vs, where it was before Luther began to preache that ye cal the Goſpel.

The Doctours of Lipſia wil haue three, not one more, nor one leſſe. Melanchthon at Wittenberg, and they of his bande, wil needes haue foure at the leaſt. Others ſome there be, that content them ſelues with one. Al the reſte they refuſe. And now of late yeres, as this Goſpel is a Proceeding Goſpel, and remaineth not long in one ſorte of Doctrine, there be vnder the kingdome of Pole, that haue abandoned the neceſsitie of al the Sacramentes of the newe Teſtament, and require the Iewiſhe Circumciſion to be reſtored. It is mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered alſo, that in ſome places, where this Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is hoteſt, that the Paſchal Lambe is called for. O merciful God, whyther wil this Goſpel proceede at length?</p>
                  <p>But what neede I to ſpeake of the ſtrifes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, that were, and be in our time betwixt the chiefe Maiſters of this new Religion? They were at debate, not onely ſide againſt ſide, men againſt men, Preachers of one Churche againſt Preachers of an other Churche: but alſo many of them, and that of the moſt famous, were at debate with them ſelues. Bucer with Bucer,<note place="margin">Bucer.</note> Melanchthon with Melanchthon, Luther with Luther, Caluine with Caluine, Peter Martyr with Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. What a doo had Bucer to keepe him ſelfe in credite with any ſide, who, after he ranne out of his Cloiſter, and tooke vnto him a Yokefellowe, firſte became a Lutheran, after that a Zuinglian,
<pb facs="tcp:12789:60"/> and againe a Lutheran, and laſt of al, after he came into England, as it is wel knowen, nor perfite Lutheran, nor perfite Zuinglian, but an vncertaine, and ambiguous Mongrel betwen bothe?</p>
                  <p>Melanchthon,<note place="margin">Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon.</note> as the worlde hath ſeene, and as it may be proued by ſundry his editions of his Common places, and other writinges, was ſo mutable in his Faith, that he ſemeth to haue made him ſelfe a ſlaue ſubiecte to al occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of mutations. As he was neuer ſtable in his life time, ſo a litle before his death, he turned wholly from his olde Maiſter Luther, and became a Caluinian Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie, as his Epiſtle witneſſeth written to the Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue of Rhene, and ſo died in the woorſt change of al.</p>
                  <p>To declare how Luther<note place="margin">Luther.</note> diſagreed with him ſelfe, bothe in deedes and writinges, it would require a whole booke. The ſame hath ben at large ſet forth by Cochleus, and other learned men of our time. What be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, wherein Caluine<note place="margin">Caluine.</note> fighteth with him ſelfe, and other his infinite errours, and confuſions, Nicolaus Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagno that learned man, and valiant knight of S.

                  <p>Who ſo euer wil ſtand in his defence, this that I ſhal here ſay, can not be denied. At Straſburg, from whence he came into England, he profeſſed the Faith of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12789:60"/> for otherwiſe he ſhoulde not haue receiued ſtipende for his Lecture of the Magiſtrates there. But at Oxforde he changed his Faith of Straſburg, for the Faith of king Edwardes Courte. For which cauſe he was not receiued againe at Straſburg, at his returne out of England in Quene Maries reigne, and therefore he tooke ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion, as he could gete at Zurich in Suitzerland. So Peter Martyr of Straſburg, agreed not with Peter Martyr of Oxford, as the world knoweth, and his bookes doo witneſſe. And it may be doubted, whether Peter Martyr of Oxford, agreed with Peter Martyr of Zurich. What confuſion is this?</p>
                  <p>To dwel no longer in this lothſom matter, what Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonical confuſion is in the chiefe Doctours of this new founde Goſpel, if there were nothing els to be ſaid, it might appeare by that we find, that Gaſpar Querchamer<note place="margin">Gaſpar Quercha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> a learned laye man, hath gathered together ſix and thirty places repugnant the one to the other, vpon the one only Article of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vnder one or both Kindes: and by that Oſiander writeth of Melanchthon and his folowers, that they helde .xx.

                     <p>Yea I ſay furthermore, what is that ſharpenes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, whiche in this caſe, I meane, when the auctoritie of the Councels, and holy Fathers is ſo lightly contemned, when Gods holy Myſteries are ſo turkiſhly prophaned, when the Churche is ſo falſly ſclaundered, when vnitie is ſo with moſt certaine danger of Chriſtian ſoules bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when the whole ſtate of the Catholique Religion is ſo wickedly ouerthrowen, briefly when God him ſelfe is ſo horribly blaſphemed: In this caſe I ſay, what ſharpenes of wordes is there, which iuſte griefe of a Chriſtian harte, and godly zeale, cauſeth not to ſeeme, not onely excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but alſo laudable, yea neceſſary, yea with praiſe, and reward to be honoured?</p>

                     <p>What, you are very nice M Iewel, that finde ſo great faulte with me onely for certaine ſharpe wordes beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in reprehenſion of your, and your companions ſo diuers, and ſo greeuous enormities. You are not taken vp for halting (as they ſay) pardy. Halting may haue ſome excuſe of humaine infirmitie. This that is reprehended in you, is not only halting, it is falling downe right.

                     <p>Now in this caſe, the pitte being ſo dangerous, is it not wel, and dewtifully done, to geue warning to Gods people to beware of it? Al that I writte, is for the peoples

And how can the greatnes of this peril be ſignified vnto them, but with wordes of ſome vehemencie? As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: If I ſhould ſay to one that goeth forth by night, ſir, the way you ſhal paſſe through, is vneeuen, by reaſon of litle holes and furrowes: And you take not heede, you may happen to ſtumble, or perhappes to wrentche your foote. Vpon this warning, wil he be ſo careful how to go, as if I ſay thus, If you loue your life, beware how you go that way, for there be great pittes, and dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, that you ſhal hardly eſcape, and if you fal, you are ſure to breake your necke.</p>
                     <p>The caſe is like in this behalfe M. Iewel. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be alwaies going foreward, and for lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they paſſe forth, as it were by night.

                     <p>For this cauſe therefore M. Iewel, that the people of God might be the more a fraid to heare you, and beleeue you, and to folow your damnable waies: I thought it good and expedient, in writing againſt you, and againſt the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12789:67"/> gentle waye, afterward in my Confutation of the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and in my Reioindre, I choſe the meane, that by the one extreme I might not ſeeme to worke vpon choler, and to ſeeke reuenge, rather then Defence of Gods cauſe, by the other, to be too abiecte, and to ſhew leſſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our cauſe, to thincouragement of ſuch cockiſh Aduerſaries.</p>
                  <p>Now commeth me M.

If lyers ſhould be entreated in like ſorte as true reporters, ſlaunderers, and backebyters, as faithful frendes, heretikes, as catholikes, Apoſtates, as ſtedfaſt Chriſtians; blaſphemers, as ſaintes: truth ſhould be iniured, wickednes flattered, vertue miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed.

                  <p>Neither with more truth hath he alleaged that other ſaying of myne, which ſtanding by it ſelfe alone, as he hath placed it in his booke immediatly after the former falſified ſaying, geueth out a colourable ſhew, as if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned my ſelfe.

It is not reaſon Biſhops be iudges in matters of faith, and not ſecular Princes. Now to geue a colour hereto, and to moue Princes to take the matter into their owne handes, they ſay, as becommeth them and none els.

For if any ſuch Prince be not a fauorer of their Goſpel, then haue they a Blaſt of a Trompet to blow him downe, as it appeareth by their bookes made againſt the monſtrous regiment of women, and by the good obedience their French brethren the Huguenotes kepe toward their king in France.

                  <p>The circumſtance of this whole matter conſidered (which may better be ſeene in my booke) I reporte me to the diſcrete Reader, whether any iuſt cauſe be miniſtred to M.

                  <p>But why did he nippe of thoſe foure wordes, <hi>with ſo impudent lyes?</hi> Doth not this diſcouer his falſehode, and ſhew of whom that ſaying was meant? It ſemed good to ſuch a lyer, to ſhifte away the mention of Lyes from the Readers eyes, that he might not ſeme charged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Thus al his aduantage ſtandeth in falſehode.

Then he accuſeth the inflammation of my choler, becauſe alluding to the wordes of Daniel, I glaunced at the name of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronners of Antichriſte, therewith rubbing him and his holy companions, as it were on their gaulle, for <hi>the Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſpite</hi> they ſhew to the bleſſed ſacrifice of Chriſte my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically repreſented, and truly continewed in the dayly Sacrifice of the Church, now called the Maſſe.

                  <p>But what if I haue vttered no ſuch peece of ſentence in al that Preface? True it is Reader, I haue no ſuch ſaying there in deede. If thou wouldſt faine ſaue M. Iewels ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,

                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> why hath he put this note in the ſecond place?

                  <p>An other note of vncourteous wordes imputed vnto me by M. Iewel, is this.</p>

                  <p>Neither be theſe my wordes, thus laid together. In deede bicauſe Satan brought Luther in hatred of the Maſſe by his night diſputation that he had with him, and M.

                  <head>What was the propre errour of Pope Iohn. 22. touching the Soules departed.</head>
                  <p>The errour of Pope Iohn the. 22. was not, that the Soules of the wicked be not pouniſhed before the daie of the laſte Iudgement: but that the ſoules of the good, ſee not the face of God, before the laſte daie. His Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or opinion was conceiued with theſe termes, as the Scholaſtical Doctours then vſed to ſpeake, or the like, as we finde in Adrianus that learned Pope,<note place="margin">Adrianus in 4.

                  <p>This mater was muche diſputed of among the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diuines of that time. The Queſtion was thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12789:90"/> as it appeareth by <hi>Benedictus Extrauagante.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>An anima iuſtorum hominum, in quibus nihil erat purgabile, cùm de hoc ſeculo deceſſerunt, vel ſi quid erat, iam purgatum fuerat ex toto, poſt mortem ſuam videant Diuinam eſſentiam, ante corporum ſuorum reſumptionem, &amp; iudicium generale.</hi> As muche to ſaie in Engliſh: whether the Soules of iuſte menne, in whiche there was nothing to be purged, when they departed out of this worlde, or if there were any thing, the ſame had ben now wholly purged, after their death, ſee the Diuine eſſence before the receiuing againe of their bodies, and before the general Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Of this Queſtion ſome Doctours then helde the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue, ſome the negatiue. Amongſt them that helde the Negatiue, this Pope Iohn. 22. was one before he was Pope, and perhaps alſo afterward. But he helde it only as his priuate opinion. As touching Decree, or definition in that behalfe either againſt, or with the truth, doubteleſſe it can not be proued by any ſtorie of eſtimation, that he made any. Who of al menne is more to be beleeued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then Benedictus the eleuenth that was Cardinal in his time, and ſucceded him? This Benedictus ſaith, that Pope Iohn prepared him ſelfe to make a Deciſion and a perfite determination of that queſtion. And to thintent the truth might be exactly tried out, he gaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement in his publique Conſiſtorie (whereat the ſaid Benedictus was then preſent, as he ſaith him ſelfe) vnto the Cardinals, Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lates, and Doctors of diuinitie, who were there in great number, to prouide for the due examination of that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that when they ſhould be required, euery man ſhould ſaie deliberately, what he thought of it. Yet (ſaith Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus) being preuented by death, as it pleaſed our Lorde,
<pb facs="tcp:12789:91"/> he could not performe that he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. The ſame was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed by Benedictus ſtreight after Pope Iohns death.</p>
                  <p>Now this was an errour in Pope Iohn, I denie not. Yet for the ſame is not he to be accompted an heretique, as neither S. Irenaeus, Theophylactus, and S. Bernarde are, who ſeme to haue bene of the ſame opinion, as it is by ſome learned menne gathered and iudged of certaine ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges founde in their workes. Certainely it was no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, for ſo muche as the matter was not at that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely defined by the Churche, but afterward by <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus</hi> the eleuenth, and at length by the Councel of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnder Eugenius the fourth.</p>
                  <p>This is the vntrue doctrine of Pope Iohn. 22. of which Gerſon ſpeaketh, farre otherwiſe then M. Iewel repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, in a Sermon, that he made before the Frenche king then being, <hi>in feſto Paſchali.</hi>

And it is verely to be beleeued, that he gaue this glorious peace to al them that were in Purgatorie, and that he deliuered them, as a king doth at his first ioyous comming

And of purpoſe this did he vnto the Theefe, who of likelyhoode had not yet fulfilled his penaunce for al his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: who was in that very houre made bleſſed, and ſaw God face to face, as the Saintes doo in Paradiſe.

                  <p>Immediatly vpon this folow the wordes, by whiche it appeareth, that by verdite of Gerſon, Pope Iohns errour was, as is afore ſaid. For there he ſaith. <hi>Propter quod ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paret falſitas doctrinae Papae Iohannis. 22. quae damnata fuit cum ſono buccinarum vel tubarum coram rege Philippo auun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo tuo per Theologos Pariſienſes, &amp;c.</hi> For the which thing the falſhed of the doctrine of Pope Iohn the. 22. appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, whiche was condemned at the ſounde of Trumpets before king Philip thy vncle by the Diuines of Paris.</p>
                  <p>Remember good Reader, this errour of Iohn. 22. was not condemned by the Diuines of Paris, when he was Pope, but before, when he was a priuate Doctor, and liued in the realme of Fraunce. Whom notwithſtanding Gerſon calleth Pope, for that, he was Pope afterward, and died Pope. And thus wrote Gerſon of him long after his death.</p>
                  <p>Laie al this, and that I ſaid before in my Confutation together M. Iewel, and this matter of Pope Iohn the. 22. is fully anſwered, and you remaine ſtil charged with Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe, and al the ſcorneful talke that you vtter of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie in your pretenſed defence page. 617. is founde, vaine, light, and vnlearned, and vtterly beſide the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For the queſtion, wherein Pope Iohn is ſaid to haue erred, was onely touching the ſoules of the iuſte and perfit, who were fully purged before their departure hence (<hi>in quibus nihil erat purgabile, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de hoc ſeculo deceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi> as it is ſhewed in Pope Benedictus Decretale before

                  <p>Depoſition is of two ſortes: the one, which is ſolemne, and with terrour, when not only by ſentence, a Clerke is depriued of his holy Orders (though the character yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, but vnprofitable to the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy Orders) but alſo in deede and actually his head is ſhauen, his ſacred

                     <note place="margin">Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> which is not vſed, but when the offenders faulte is ſo great, that he is to be deliuered to the ſecular power, to be pouniſhed,<note place="margin">C.

                  <p>And alſo withal, this open pouniſhement of depoſition for the open ſinne of fornication in a Clerke, was <hi>in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio Grangrenſi</hi> changed into ten yeres penance to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed after a very ſtreight, and auſtere ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner and forme, as that Councel preſcribeth.

For if it were but the figure of Chriſtes body that he helde in his hande, when he ſaid, <hi>this is my bodie:</hi> what wonder was it? Dauid of whom there he ſpeaketh, could haue done that, yea what is that man, that can not beare the figure of his bodie in his handes? But S.

And here conſider Reader, how S. Auguſtine ſpeaketh, as if it were of purpoſe, to take awaie al occaſion of cauil from ſuche heretiques, as ſhould denie the real preſence, whiche M. Iewel doth.
<pb facs="tcp:12789:105"/> The bodie, that Chriſt commended and gaue vnto his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, was (ſaith S.

                  <pb facs="tcp:12789:118"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident by Chriſtes owne promiſe, and by your owne Confeſsion. The <hi>Minor</hi> you confeſſe alſo both in your Apologie, and in this pretenſed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as I ſaid before.

                  <p>You adde yet farther. Chriſte wil be euermore with his Churche, <hi>yea though the whole Churche of Rome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt him.</hi> It is true M. Iewel. And therefore this being a matter impoſsible, that the whole Churche of Rome ſhould be hable to deface Chriſtes Goſpel, or to defeate Chriſt of his promiſe: it muſt needes folow, that, where you ſay, <hi>the Pope hath blinded the whole worlde,</hi> you haue ſaid moſt vntruly, and haue auouched that thing, which by your owne confeſsion in this place, was not poſsible to be done.</p>
                  <p>Againe ſeing that, though the whole Churche of Rome conſpired againſt Chriſte, yet Chriſte wil be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more with his Churche, and theſe many hundred yeres Chriſt hath had no other Churche then the Churche of Rome (for <hi>the Pope</hi> you ſay <hi>hath blinded the whole worlde, and D. Luther began to publiſh the Goſpel, a general darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe going before</hi>): it muſt needes folowe, that the ſame Church of Rome was the true Church of Chriſt, that the ſaid Church neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired againſt Chriſt, that the Pope neuer blinded, nor was euer hable to blinde the whole worlde: briefely, that the ſame whiche you cal blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, was good ſight, and that which you cal darkeneſſe, was cleare light.</p>
                  <p>Verely either ſo muſt it be, or Chriſtes promiſe muſt faile. Of the which promiſe of Chriſt, and of a number of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12789:118"/> other ſayinges in the Pſalmes, in the Prophetes, and in the Goſpel affirming, and confirming the ſame, it hath ben largely and ſufficiently treated in the foreſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe intituled, <hi>The Fortreſſe of our firſt Faith,</hi> annexed to the Hiſtorie of venerable Bede, of late tranſlated into Engliſhe. If you M. Iewel, or any of your fellowes wil auoide this argument, that proueth a knowen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Chriſtes Church, anſwer to the firſt parte of that booke. If you can not auoide that one Argument, your newe doctrine is plainely proued to be falſe, and heretical, and the Faith of our Forefathers is plainely proued, to be the Faith of the true, and onely Catholike Churche of Chriſte in earth.</p>
                  <p>You pretende as if ye had aduantage, for that I ſpake but of a thouſand yeres. For thus you inferre.</p>

A great folie it is for you, and your felowes to contemne the General Councelles of late yeres, for that they be newe, as you ſay, your ſelues and your doctrine being yet ſo newe, and of ſo litle age. Verely no age, or time of Chriſtes Churche to any Chriſten man ought to ſeeme newe in reſpecte of doctrine and faith.

If this Argument be naught, let him amend it, that framed it. If it be ridiculous, the Reader may ſee, what a ridiculous head he hath, that brought it forth. My reaſon dependeth in this ſorte. If it had pleaſed Chriſt to haue remained here viſibly emong
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12789:177"/> vs alwaies, and to haue taken continual order him ſelfe for the external gouernment of the Churche: we ſhould not haue needed any other general head, but Chriſte him ſelfe, who had ben ſufficient.

                  <p>The common ſaying is, the blinde eateth many a flie. Euen ſo doth M. Iewel, for lacke of dewe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration deuoure many a ſoule errour. S. Chryſoſtome hath not one iote in this place that maketh for M. Iewel. He ſpeaketh of that ſtoute confidence, that Peter had of him ſelfe, when he ſaid:<note place="margin">

Chryſoſtome: Firſt, in that he withſtoode Chriſte, and conſidered not what was alleged out of Zacharie the Prophet before, who ſaid, <hi>I wil ſmite the ſhepeheard, and the ſheepe ſhal be ſcattered:</hi> Yet S. Peter (were it for the great loue, and the affection, that he bare to his Maiſter, or were he touched with ſome ambition, and truſted to wade through of him ſelfe without farther helpe of ſpecial grace) warranted the mater, that he would neuer fal from Chriſte. There is one of his faultes.</p>
                  <p>The other faulte is, <hi>Quoniam praepoſuit ſe illis,</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he prefered him ſelfe before the other Apoſtles. What meaneth that, M. Iewel, ſaie you? What ſo euer you would menne ſhould thinke of it, it maketh no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The right meaning of the place is, that Peter offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſecond time, bicauſe he thought him ſelfe more ſure, as touching ſtanding to his Maiſter, then al the reſte of the Apoſtles. What is this to the meaning, that you would faine wring out of this place: that Peter was not Head of the Apoſtles? In the ſelfe ſame Homilie before S. Chryſoſtome calleth him, <hi>verticem Apoſtolorum,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:12789:184"/> very Head, and chiefeſt of al the Apoſtles. <hi>Etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ipſum Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verticem negare permiſit:</hi> Chriſt ſuffered (ſaith he) the toppe, or head him ſelfe of the Apoſtles, to denie him.</p>
                  <p>Againe, S. Chryſoſtome faithe in an other Homilie, as is afore tolde, that Peter had committed vnto him the charge,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom. <hi>55.</hi> in Matt.</note> and gouernment of the whole worlde. Thus you may ſee, how al thinges go againſt the heare (as they ſay) with you M. Iewel, thus alwaies to allege ſuche ſayinges out of the Fathers, as further not your cauſe but rather hinder it. So ſhal al they doo, that fight againſt the Truth.</p>

Marke had ſo written, how can you wreſte it to your purpoſe? Thus it is good Reader. Our Sauiour gaue a general warning, not onely to the Apoſtles, but to al menne beleeuing in him, to be watcheful againſt our Lordes comming, which ſhal be ſuddeinely, at ſuche time as they know not, and therefore ſaid, <hi>Vigilate, watche ye &amp;c.</hi> That it ſhoulde not be thought he meant only of the Apoſtles, to whom he ſpake: he added in the ende (not as M.

                  <p>This is M. Iewels worthy Argument, this is the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he geueth vnto him ſelfe, this is his new profounde Logique. He might by this Scripture as eaſily haue concluded, that al Chriſtians, as wel of the laie and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſorte, were as wel commaunded to Feede Chriſtes Lambes, and ſheepe, as Peter him ſelfe, or the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. For if he wil grate vpon the wordes (not as he falſly allegeth them, <hi>quod vni dico, omnibus dico,</hi> what I ſaie to one, I ſaie to al) whiche are not in the Scripture, but, <hi>quod autem vobis dico, omnibus dico,</hi> what I ſaie to you (myne Apoſtles) I ſaie to al (Chriſtians) Why maie not euery Tinker, and Sowter take vpon him to Feede Chriſtes Lambes, and Sheepe, ſaying, if he be rebuked for his preſumption, He that ſaid to Peter, Feede my Sheepe, ſaid he not to al in general, <hi>What I ſaie to one, I ſaie to al?</hi> And if he ſaid to al, wherefore ſhoulde I not feede Chriſtes flocke, as wel as Peter?</p>
                  <p>Yea, if either S. Markes Scripture, <hi>What I ſaie to you</hi> (myne Apoſtles) <hi>I ſaie to al,</hi> or M.

Therefore, for the auoiding of this abſurditie, whiche would followe vpon Falcidius falſe aſſertion, it behoued him, and ſuche as helde with him, vtterly to reuoke that errour, that Deacons are, either aboue Prieſtes,<note place="margin">That a Prieſt is aboue a Deacon.</note> or equal with them. A Prieſt maie doo al that a Biſhop doth, ſaue that he can not geue Orders: A Deacon can not doo al thinges that a Biſhop doth, ſaue onely the geuing of Orders: for he can not conſecrate the body and bloude of Chriſt in the bleſſed Sacrament: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Prieſt that hath more power then the Deacon, muſt be aboue the Deacon.</p>
                  <p>This is S. Hieromes very drifte in that Epiſtle to <hi>Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius,</hi> with the whiche meaning of S. Hieromes, your authour <hi>Eraſmus</hi> doth wel agree,<note place="margin">Eraſmus in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doto. poſt Scholiam in epiſt. ad Euagriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> where he writeth thus vpon the ſame Epiſtle. <hi>Itaque quòd hic aequat humilium vrbium Epiſcopos cum alijs, ad Diaconos eſt referendum, qui
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:12789:191"/> nonnullis locis praeferebantur presbyteris, quos propemodum aquat Epiſcopis. Where as he doth here equally matche the Biſshoppes of the meaner Cities, with other</hi> (that are Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopps of great Cities) <hi>it is ſpoken for the Deacons ſake: who in certaine places were preferred before the prieſtes, whom almoſt he maketh Biſshoppes felowes.</hi> And againe, <hi>In hoc igitur aequales ſunt Epiſcopi, &amp; presbyteri, quòd vbicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſunt, Diaconis ſunt praeferendi.</hi> Touching this pointe Biſhoppes and Prieſtes are equal, for that they are to be preferred before Deacons, where ſo euer they be.</p>
                  <p>But that there is greate difference in authoritie of gouernement betwixte Biſhoppes', Prieſtes, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, S. Hierome is plaine in the laſte ſentence of that Epiſtle, where he writeth thus. <hi>Et vt ſciamus tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones Apostolicas ſumptas de veteri Testamento, quod Aaron &amp; filij eius, atque Leuitae in Templo fuerunt, hoc ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Epiſcopi, &amp; Presbyteri, &amp; Diaconi vendicent in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> And that we maie knowe, the Apoſtles Traditions were taken out of the olde Teſtament, what Aaron, and his Sonnes, and the Leuites were in the Temple, Biſſhoppes, Prieſtes, and Deacons, maie chalenge to them ſelfe, the ſame in the Churche. But Aaron being the high Prieſt, and Biſſhop, was in auctoritie farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al the reſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> if Prieſtes be named in Scripture Biſſhoppes, as S. Hierome reaſoneth againſt their folie, that preferred Deacons aboue Prieſtes: There is one Biſſhoppe founde out, that ought to haue ſpecial rule ouer al the reſte, and that by a conſequent of the very Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Whereas S. Hierome condemned the lewde diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the Citie of Rome, not of the Churche of
<pb facs="tcp:12789:192"/> Rome (as M. Iewel vntruly interpreteth) which he ſaith is one with the Churche of the whole worlde, keeping one rule of truth with the reſt, for hauing Deacons in more honour then Prieſtes, and putteth the mater to be tried by authoritie, ſaying, that the authoritie of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal Church of the whole worlde, with the which the Church of Rome is one, is rather to be folowed, then the corrupte manner and cuſtome of that one Citie: there is no reaſon, why he ſhould ſeeme in that place to haue vſed the word <hi>Merite,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Merite for Pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, after M. Ievvelles iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> for this worde <hi>Preeminence,</hi> as M. Iewel ful vainely iangleth, and can not prooue. His ſeely argumentes ſtande thus: The authoritie of the worlde, that is to ſaie, of the vniuerſal Churche of the whole worlde, and therefore of the Churche of Rome alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing One Churche with the reſte, is greater then the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Citie of Rome: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the worde <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> in the nexte ſentence folowing muſt ſignifie <hi>Pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence.</hi> Againe, the power of riches, and the baſeneſſe of pouertie, maketh not a Biſhop either higher, or lower: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the worde <hi>Merite,</hi> in the ſentence before muſte ſignifie <hi>Preeminence.</hi> This is ſtrange Logique, by vſe whereof euery foole maie ſeeme to reaſon wiſely, if it were once allowed in open ſchooles.<note place="margin">The vvorld is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Citie, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas S. Hierome to Euagrius ſpeaking againſt the euil cuſtome of Rome, where a Deacon was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before a Prieſte, ſaieth, <hi>Si authoritas quaeritur, Orbis maior eſt vrbe.</hi> If wee ſeeke for Authoritie, the worlde is more then the Citie: he meaneth not, as the circumſtance of that Epiſtle geueth, that authoritie there ſhould ſignifie, authoritie in gouernement, as M. Iewel hath interpreted, making S. Hierome to ſaie, that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:12789:192"/> in Authoritie of gouernement, the whole worlde is greater then the Citie of Roome, whereby he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to diſplace the Pope, and to depriue him of his authoritie in gouernement, and to beſtowe it confuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abroade in al the worlde, whereof in deede, the Confuſion whiche they may beſte holde, and ſtande by, might be procured: The truthe is, S. Hierome there is not to be vnderſtanded to ſpeake of the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in gouernement, but of common, and publique authoritie to be folowed for auoiding of that errour, that made a Deacon better then a Prieſte, or at leaſt equal with a Prieſt. In Controuerſies we folowe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Now ſaith S. Hierome. If we ſeeke for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, the worlde is greater then the Citie. As who ſhould ſaie, let no man defende the errour by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Citie of Rome, bicauſe there a Deacon is preferred before a Prieſte: for what ſhal we eſteme the cuſtome of one Citie, the whole world holding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie? And the authoritie of no one Citie, can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the authoritie of the whole worlde. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pretending one to obiecte vnto him, that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was at Rome for a Prieſt to be ordered at the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a Deacon, he ſaieth, <hi>Quid mihi profers vnius vrbis conſuetudinem:</hi> what bringeſt me foorth the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of one Citie? As who ſhould ſay,<note place="margin">Neither at Rome vvas more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to Deacons, then to Prieſtes.</note> it were not to be regarded in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of the cuſtom of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Nowe that the Churche of Rome gaue not greater honour to Deacons, then to Prieſtes, by S. Hierome him ſelfe it ſeemeth to be euident, for ſo muche as Prieſtes there ſate in the Church, where Deacons vſed to ſtande, and the Deacons neuer durſte to ſitte emonge the
<pb facs="tcp:12789:193"/> Prieſtes,<note place="margin">Hiero. in eade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol. ad e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uagriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> whiles the Biſſhop was preſent.

Whereby it is manifeſt, that the preferring of Deacons aboue Prieſtes, roſe not of any ordinarie cuſtome of the Churche of Rome, where al ſtates beſt keept due order in the Biſſhoppes preſence, but of the priuate pride of ſome Deacons, and of the ſimplicitie of the people of that Citie. Therefore S. Hierome ſaith not, <hi>Quid mihi profers Romanae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae conſuetudinem, why bringest me forth the cuſtome of the Romaine Churche:</hi> but, <hi>Quid mihi profers vnius vrbis conſuetudinem?

Now S. Hieromes wordes doo ſignifie, that a Biſhop is of the ſame Merite, and of the ſame Prieſthood, whether he be Biſhop of a great Citie, or of a litle. And here is to be noted, that M.

                  <p>How ſo euer you bring in S. Hierome for the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Prieſtes with Biſhoppes, it forceth not. It is wel knowen, S.

If God haue a ſpecial regarde to the ſafetie of the Churche, and if the Churche can not be ſafe, without there be a peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and a ſupreme power yeelded vnto the higheſt Prieſt, whiche is a Biſhop, as S.

M. Iewel had neede to looke better vpon his booke, and to learne by theſe places better to tempre the other ſayinges of S. Hierome. S.

                  <p>That you ſaie of <hi>Innocentius,</hi> is vtterly falſe. He was not ſo reproued of pride, and worldely Lordeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as more like a proud worldely Lordeling, then

Neither was Innocentius then a liue, when the Aphrican Councel was holden, but departed this life long before. I graunt there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant an epiſtle of the Aphrican Councel to the learned Pope Coeleſtinus, in whiche Epiſtle Innocentius that bleſſed man is not once touched. Neither was the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that whole Councel ſo ſmal, as to ſpeake ſo il of a holy Biſhop ſo long before departed. The manner of thoſe Fathers was to praie for ſuche, ſpecially for the Biſhoppes of Rome deceaſſed rehearſing their names in their Maſſes, and in no wiſe to reporte ſo il of them. How be it, in that whole epiſtle Pope Innocentius is not ſo muche as once named, nor ſpoken of. There we finde theſe three wordes <hi>fumoſum typhum ſeculi,</hi> that is to ſaie, the ſmoky pride of the worlde (or the vaine ſtouteneſſe of the temporaltie) but in a farre other ſenſe, and to an other purpoſe, then M.

                  <p>Whether he rightly vnderſtode the place, or no, I haue good cauſe to doubte. It ſeemeth that the Biſhop of Rome in the cauſe of <hi>Appiarius</hi> (whom the Aphrican Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes had depoſed, and remoued from his Biſhprike, for crimes not ſufficiently proued) ſent his Clerkes, that were his Agentes in Aphrica, vnto certaine noble menne of the Countrie bearing offices vnder the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, to require their aſsiſtence, if neede ſhould ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: whiche is as muche to ſaie, as now we vſe to

With this the Aphrican Biſhoppes did muche miſlike, and therefore beſought Pope Coeleſtine, that it ſhould no more be donne, but that maters might be ended by them, being Biſhoppes of that prouince, without al intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the laie power.

O ſay you, <hi>Leo</hi> maketh Peter receiued into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of the indiuiſible vnitie. I graunt M. Iewel. But what indiuiſible vnitie meaneth he?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, al vnitie is indiuiſible. For where there is a Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a thing into two, three, or moe,<note place="margin">Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vvith Chriſt.</note> there is not vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but multiplicitie. Now there is vnitie of Subſtance, and vnitie of qualitie. S. Peter is not reported of Leo, to be aſſumpted into the felowſhip of vnitie of Subſtance, or of nature with Chriſte the Sonne of God, for ſo he ſhould haue made him equal with God, as Chriſt is, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is of one Subſtance, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantial with God, but that, which is God. Which God, though he be three in Perſons, yet is one in Subſtance. Into this indiuiſible vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Subſtance Peter is not receiued, which ful deuiliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you would the Reader to conceiue and imagine to be the meaning of S. Leo in thoſe wordes.</p>
                  <p>Into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of the indiuiſible vnitie of a qualitie, or grace, or name with Chriſt, S. Peter was aſſumpted, that is to ſaie: Chriſt gaue him a qualitie, a grace, a name, that is proper to him ſelfe. What is that? Leo expoundeth him ſelfe: <hi>That which he was him ſelfe, he willed Peter to be named, ſaying. Thou arte Peter,</hi> aſmuch to ſaie, thou art a Rocke, <hi>and vpon this Rocke I wil builde my Church</hi> (and leaſt we ſhould thinke, that Chriſt gaue him that name onely, and not the thing ſignified by that name: Leo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further) <hi>Vt aeterni aedificatio te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pli, mirabili munere gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae Dei in Petri ſoliditate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteret,</hi> that the building of his

                  <p>But let vs heare Leo expounding him ſelf more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus he ſaith: <hi>Euangelica ſiquidem referente hiſtoria, &amp;c. As the ſtorie of the Goſpel telleth, our Lorde aſketh of al the Apoſtles, what menne thought of him. And ſo long as they be in declaring the doubtefulneſſe of mannes vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the talke of them that anſwer, is common among them al. But when it is required, of what ſenſe the Diſciples are, there he is firſt in confeſsing our Lorde, which is firſte in the Apoſtolike dignitie. Who, when he had ſaid: Thou arte the Sonne of the liuing God: Ieſus anſwered him: Bleſſed arte thou Simon the ſonne of Iona, bicauſe fleſhe and bloude hath not reueled</hi> (this) <hi>vnto thee, but my Father, that is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore bleſſed arte thou, bicauſe my Father hath taught thee, neither hath earthly opinion deceiued thee, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly inſpiration hath instructed thee, and it is not fleſhe and bloude, that hath ſhewed me vnto thee, but it is he, whoſe onely begotten Sonne I am. And I, quod he, tel thee, that is, as my Father hath manifeſted my diuinitie vnto thee, ſo I make knowen to thee, thine excellencie. Quia tu es Petrus, id eſt, cùm ego ſim inuiolabilis Petra, ego lapis angularis, qui facio vtraque vnum, tamen tu quoque Petra es, quia mea virtute ſolidaris, vt quae mihi poteſtate ſunt propria, ſint tibi mecum participatione communia.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Peter is aſmuche to ſaie, as Rocke.</note> Bicauſe thou art Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is, whereas I am the inuiolable Rocke, I the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſtoane, whiche make both one, yet thou alſo arte the Rocke, bicauſe by my vertue thou arte made ſounde and ſure, that the thinges which are proper vnto me by
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:12789:201"/> power, maie be common to thee with me by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus farre Leo.</p>
                  <p>By theſe laſte wordes he declareth vnto vs, how Chriſte receiued Peter into the companie of his indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible vnitie, to witte, by admitting him to enter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (as I might ſaie) with him, and by making him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker throughe free gifte, of that name, and not of that name onely, but alſo of that excellencie, whiche is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes owne by power.

For ſo he muſt ſaie of the Princes, as he ſaith of the Prieſte, and Biſhop, that he is a King, or ſhe a Queene, by a worde of double meaning, as for example, <hi>vnſauery ſalte is called ſalte, or as the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Baal, are called Prophetes, or as a painted manne, is called a man, or,</hi> as S.

Thoughe with your Rhetorique you maie doo muche, and beguile the ſimple, yet thinke not, but the wiſe doo ſee, whyther the maintenaunce of this doctrine tendeth.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:12789:213"/> hundred thirty and ſix Biſhops) would haue offered that name vnto the Pope, whiche by no meanes could be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of him. S.

If it may be agreeable vnto the Pope in any ſenſe, it is in this, bicauſe he is the chiefe of al Biſhops, who by office hath care of the whole Churche. For the name of Vniuerſal muſt needes haue reſpecte to the Whole Churche. And in that only ſenſe did the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that Councel of Chalcedon offer that name to the Pope, bicauſe they knew that thing, dignitie, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be in the Pope, for that he is S.

                  <p>Boniface the third obteined of Phocas the Emperour (although not without great difficultie) that the See of the bleſſed Apoſtle Peter, whiche is the Head of al Churches, ſhould both ſo be called, and alſo taken of al men, the which place (or preferment) the Churche of Conſtantinople went about to chalenge, wicked princes ſometimes helping foreward the matter, affirming, that the chiefe See ought to be in that place, where the Head of the Empire was. The biſhops of Rome auouched, that the citie of Rome was for good cauſe to be taken for the Head of the Empire, as from whence the citie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople had benne tranſlated: Whereas alſo the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians them ſelues cal their Prince, the Emperour of the Romains, and they of Conſtantinople euen in our daies are called Romaines, and not Grecians. I let paſſe, how Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the prince of the Apoſtles gaue vnto his Succeſſours the Biſhops of Rome, the Keies of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and leafte the power, that was geuen him of God, not to Conſtantinople, but to Rome.

                  <p>Chriſt therefore had not onely a moſt perfite Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is deſcribed in the Goſpel, from Adam til Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph the husbande of the Virgin Marie: but alſo with that his Succeſsion he ſtopped al the mouthes of his Enemies.

                  </p>
                  <p>Here it is firſt to be noted, that the Scribes, and Phariſees knew Chriſt to haue a Succeſsion from Dauid. For his Sonne (they ſaid) he muſt be. Therefore M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel in making the Phariſees to acknowledge no Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his, hath corrupted the texte of the Goſpel, and vttered a great Vntruthe. The Phariſees knew, that Chriſte ſhould ſuccede in the very beſte line: but they would not attende, nor conſider, how that Succeſsion was now brought to paſſe in the Sonne of Marie, who being of the howſe of Dauid, had miraculouſly brought forth Chriſte the perfite ende of the Lawe. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe M. Iewel knoweth, that the Churche of Chriſte
<pb facs="tcp:12789:234"/> muſt needes haue a perpetual Succeſsion: but he wil not conſider, how it is preſerued chiefely in the Chaier of Peter,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan.</hi> 21.</note> to whom aboue al others the ſheepe of Chriſt were committed.</p>
                  <p>Wel, Chriſte then geuing the Iewes to vnderſtand, that he ſucceeded in the line of Dauid,<note place="margin">Chriſt not only the Sonne of Dauid, but alſo the Sône of God.</note> would haue had them farther to conſider, that he alſo was the ſonne of God, and ſo ſhewed, that he, who was Dauids Sonne, was alſo called the Lord of Dauid: his Sonne by fleſh, his Lord by Godhed, which thing did put them al to ſilence. Euen ſo that weake, mortal, and ſome time miſerable, and ſinful man, whome ſitting at Rome, M.

For admitting that the Pope were not S.

                  <p>But now if wee adde hereunto, that the ſame is euen by our enemies confeſsion, and euer was the firſt See, how muche more ought they to woonder at the ſpecial prouidence of God in that behalfe? Therefore euen as it was miraculous, that the line of Dauid was ſo notably preſerued in ſo many changes, and captiuities of the Iewes: right ſo may we ſay of the Biſhoppes of Rome, in ſuche ſorte, as ſmaller thinges doo imitate the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

We ſhal now ſee, how wel you touche Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians meaning. You ſay his wordes were ſpoken of certaine my ancient Fathers. That can not be ſo. For none are in this behalfe my fathers, but thoſe, who loue wel the Succeſsion of Biſhops. But Tertullian ſpake of
<pb facs="tcp:12789:242"/> thoſe,<note place="margin">De Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. aduerſus Haret.</note> that eſteemed the Succeſsion of Biſhops, as litle as you do. And therefore they are your fathers, of whom he ſpeaketh: that is to ſay, they are Heretikes, of whom he ſpeaketh. For in dede no heretike can abide Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, bicauſe they would faine iuſtle out the olde Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſchuffle in their new Intruſion.</p>
                  <p>You ſay the men, of whom Tertullian ſpeaketh, raiſed vp a new Religion of them ſelues, and therein you ſay truth. You adde, as I alſo haue donne: but therein you belye me, for ye are not hable to laye any one point of doctrine to my charge, wherein I follow not that old Succeſsion, which abhorreth al new Religion. Let al the worlde iudge, who raiſeth vp a newe Religion, you, or I. You ſay the Heretiques, of who Tertullian ſpake, raiſed vp a new Religion without the Worde of God, example of the Apoſtles, or of holy Fathers. If you meane without the true meaning of Gods worde, you ſay truth: and then you alſo are without Gods worde, bicauſe you are without the Church, whereunto Gods worde with the true interpretation thereof was geuen: and we are not without it, bicauſe we conteine our ſelues within the Churche. But if you meane, that theſe heretikes did not ſounde the wordes of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures in their lippes, as falſely, and withal, as faſt, as you doo, then you ſay not truly.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:12789:242"/> the interpretation of the Scriptures belongeth to them,<note place="margin">It boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not to ſtriue vvith he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques about the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> who haue the true faith, and he concludeth, that they haue the true faith, who haue the perpetual Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion of Biſhoppes from the Apoſtles time til their owne daies.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12789:245"/> not euen ſo, nor in like ſorte. S. Auguſtine concluded, that the Donatiſtes were Heretikes,<note place="margin">S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And you turne al the mater of doctrine to a manner of doing. It were ſurely hard to proue, that euer any one Pope, not only of thoſe 38. whom S. Auguſtine nameth, but alſo of al the reſt til this hower, did ſay priuate Maſſe. For if M. Iewel ſhould put me to the proufe, that Paulus tertius, or Pius quartus, Federicus Fregoſius that noble and learned Biſhop of Salerno, or Bellaius that worthy Biſhop of Paris, or any the like, who liued in our time, had ſaid Priuate Maſſe, and that in ſuch wiſe, as if I were not hable to ſhew him, when they ſaid it, where they ſaid it, and who were witneſſes thereof, I ſhould not be credited for want of due proufe: I were not hable to proue it, either for that I liued not at Rome, and in the places where they made their abode, or elles bicauſe, though I liued in thoſe places, I was not ſo curious, nor careful to know, what they did therin. And ſo it would followe, by this fond collection of M. Iewels Logique, that euen yet to this daie, no Pope, nor other Biſhop, faith priuate Maſſe, bicauſe I can not proue it, and ſhew the circumſtance, where, when, and how it was donne.</p>
                  <p>Thinke you M. Iewel, that the Religion of Chriſte dependeth vpon any particular facte of menne? Is that your Diuinitie? Al the Popes, and al the Apoſtles agree with vs in Doctrine, bicauſe wee can ſhewe diuerſe Churches, whiche haue benne planted of them, and haue kepte from time to time the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whiche they receiued from hande to hande of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:12789:245"/> them. This is our demonſtration of the Truthe. This is that, whiche Chriſte allowed, when he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his diſciples to doo, and keepe, that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and Phariſees, who ſate in Moyſes chaire, bad them to keepe and doo.

And we doubte not alſo, but that it hath benne vſed for euer to be ſaid, though the people, either were not preſent, or being preſent, would not receiue with the prieſt, as it is plaine in S. Chryſoſtome,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. homil. <hi>61.</hi> ad Pop.

                  <p>Here is a deepe conſideration, I promiſe you. What if al writers being ſure of theſe foure Biſhops of Rome, yet be not ſure who was before other? Is therefore our Succeſsion vncertaine? We are wel aſſured, that Peter was the firſt, and after him there was a Second, a Third, and a Fourth. We are alſo aſſured, that the ſame were <hi>Linus, Cletus, Clemens, Anacletus.</hi> And what ſkilleth it vnto vs,<note place="margin">The true order of the firſt Popes ſucceding one an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other. <hi>Damaſus in pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calt.

                     </note> who was Second, who Third, who Fourth? But now al this buſines is ended, if we make a diſtinction. And that is this.</p>
                  <p>S.

So ſaith <hi>Damaſus</hi> in the life of S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Againe when S. Peter ſaw his death to be at hand, he choſe Clement to be his ſucceſſour, as we reade in S. <hi>Clementes</hi> epiſtle, and in <hi>Damaſus.</hi> Yea <hi>Tertullian</hi> alſo confeſſeth, that the Church of Rome <hi>ſheweth Clement to haue benne ordeined of Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:12789:246"/>
                  <p>Thus were there three Biſhops in Rome, but not three Biſhops of Rome, when S. Peter died, of the whiche S. Clement had moſt right to ſuccede. But he hauing ſeene before the good experience of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi> did yelde the adminiſtration to them, one after the other, firſt to <hi>Linus,</hi> and then to <hi>Cletus,</hi> after whoſe death Clement him ſelfe gouerned the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike See.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:12789:248"/> yet neither Peter, nor Ihon, nor Iames did geue him any thing, or make him either the better learned, or ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him with more power, and authoritie. But rather they ioined handes with S. Paule, and tooke him into their fellowſhip. Why ſo? In conſideration that they ſaw, God had no leſſe committed to him the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel vnto the Gentiles, then he had before co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the preaching of the goſpel vnto the Iewes. And how ſaw they either this, or that? Bicauſe the effect ſhewed it ſo. For as God had wrought mightily emong the Iewes in conuerting them by S.

                  <p>S. Paule then meant not in theſe wordes, that S. Peter by Chriſtes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsion had to doo only with the Iewes, and him ſelfe only with the Gentiles.<note place="margin">Act. ca. <hi>13.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the booke and worke, that you allege, is one of thoſe which Tertullian wrote againſt the Churche, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he became an Heretike, and was one of the diſciples of <hi>Montanus.</hi> For as <hi>Montanus</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the ſecond Mariages, ſo did his ſcholar Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian: Who hauing corruptly interpreted many places of S. Paule, commeth at the length to proue his hereſie
<pb facs="tcp:12789:265"/> by conferring the olde Teſtament with the new. <hi>Ecce in veteri lege, &amp;c. Beholde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the olde lawe, I finde the licence of mariyng ofte to be inhibited. It is enacted in the booke of Leuiticus, Sacerdotes mei non plus nubent, my Prieſtes ſhal not marrye any more. But the fulnes of the law, as in other pointes, ſo in this, was reſerued to Chriſte alone. VVhereupon it was more fully and more ſtreightly preſcribed, that thoſe ought bo be of one matrimonie, who are choſen in the Prieſtly ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r. In ſo much that I my ſelfe remember cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine menne for hauing had two wiues, to haue ben remoued from their place</hi> (of Prieſthod).<note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt him ſelfe.</note> 
                     <hi>But thou wilt ſay: Then is it lawful for other menne</hi> (to marrie twiſe) <hi>for ſo much as exception is made againſt them</hi> (to wit againſt Prieſtes) <hi>to whom it is not lauful</hi> (to haue ben twiſe maried). Hitherto Tertullian hath gon about by the example of the Prieſtes of the olde and new Teſtament to ſhew, that Laye men alſo may not marrye but once. For in the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment S. Paule would haue them only choſen to Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.

For al this doth the Apoſtle meane, and the auncient Fathers do ſo witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now Tertullian ſaw euidently, that there was a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwen Prieſtes, and laye menne, whereupon he made the former obiection to him ſelfe, that the ſecond mariages, which only do ſtaye a man from being Prieſt, are abſolutely lawful for him, who wil be no Prieſt, but wil remaine ſtil in the degree and ſtate of laye men. To the which obiection being to ſtrong for Tertullian, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed him ſo to anſwere, as yet his hereſie againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:12789:265"/> mariages might be mainteined. So that nowe M. Iewel bringeth forth his heretical anſwer made vnto a Catholikes argument. Thus then Tertullian goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. <hi>Vani erimus ſi putauerimus, quòd Sacerdotibus no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat, laicis licere, nonne &amp; laici Sacerdotes ſumus?</hi> We ſhal be deceiued (or we ſhalbe vaine men) if we ſhal thinke that to be lawful for Laye menne, whiche is not lawful for Prieſtes. We that are Laye men, are we not Prieſtes alſo? And ſo he goeth forward with that which M.

<pb facs="tcp:12789:266"/> vnto Biſhoppes, and prieſtes, hath doubteles relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it in other men. Not that he exhorteth them to ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mariages, but bicuaſe he yeeldeth to the neceſsitie of the fleſh. So that S. Hierome reproueth that very argument of Tertullian, which now M. Iewel ſetteth forth. And in that very place, S. Hierome nameth Tertullian, as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emie of ſecond mariages.</p>
                  <p>But verely the caſe is not like in Biſhops, and Prieſtes. For euerie man of neceſsitie is borne a laye man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were not reaſon to force him, who could not choſe but be a laye man, to marye but once, whereas none are made Prieſtes, but thoſe that know before hand, that the Apoſtle willed ſuch only to be choſen Prieſtes, as are the husbandes of one wife, that is to ſay, as haue not had two wiues, but either none, or but one. This law being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene, cauſeth it to be no iniurie, to forbid the ſecond ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, if any man wilbe an external and publike Prieſt. For he needeth not to be ſuch a Prieſt, except he him ſelfe be willing thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Againe the internal Prieſt needeth no more, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſanctitie, whiche may be kept in the ſecond ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and whereby God is ſpecially pleaſed, and that bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is only his owne Prieſt. But the external Prieſt, muſt alſo profeſſe an external ſanctitie, bicauſe he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the perſon of the whole Churche, and by his order witneſſeth,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> that the Church (as S. Paul ſaith) is deſpouſed, or maried to one husband alone, verely to Chriſt: ſo that in the internal Prieſthod it is inough to haue inward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe without any outward ſigne peculiarly belonging therunto, bicauſe it is a Prieſthod, which is geuen in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, where the ſoule is inwardly waſhed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d prepared to receiue other ſacramentes. But in the external Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:12789:266"/> there muſt be alſo an external ſigne of holines, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that external prieſthod is of it ſelfe a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that is a viſible ſigne of a holy thing wrought inwardly.<note place="margin">Internal prieſt, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d external do differ. <hi>ad Heb.</hi> 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly the internal Prieſt hath only to offer his owne ſpiritual Sacrifices vpon the Aultare of his harte: but the external Prieſt hath to offer giftes, and external Sacrifices vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the outward Altare alſo, for the ſinnes of the whole people, as S.

The Montaniſt in making it no more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a laye man to be twiſe maried, then for him to be made a Prieſt, who had ben twiſe maried: The Caluiniſt in making the internal, and external Prieſt to be al one. For whereas I reaſoned out of S. Hierome, <hi>no Prieſt</hi> (or Biſhop) <hi>and no Church</hi> (and S. Hierome meant of ſuche a Prieſt, as is aboue a Deacon) M. Iewel would proue out of Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that where three Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laye men are, there is a Church. I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe where but one Catholike layeman is, there is one of the Church, in which Church there are many external Prieſtes: but if ther be a thouſand layemen belonging to ſuch a congregation, as doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any external Sacrifice, and Prieſthod (as the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes doo not): there thoſe thowſand neither are the Church, nor of the Church, bicauſe no Church is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an external Prieſt, or Biſhop, who may offer publike Sacrifice, and alſo conſecrate an external prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Tertullian was not of this mind, that there was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Prieſthod: but his errour was,<note place="margin">Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s errour.</note> in that he wold haue the internal, and external Prieſtes to be in like caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſecond mariages. But otherwiſe his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des confeſſe, that not only the authoritie of the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:12789:267"/> but alſo <hi>the honour ſanctified of God by the aſſemblie of prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,</hi>

                  <p>Two thinges haue made this difference betwen prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, and laymen, the one is the authoritie of the Church: the other is Chriſt him ſelfe: Who beſide the authoritie of the Church, by the Sacrament of holy Orders hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted this difference of prieſtes, and of layemen. The ſacrament of holy order is geuen,<note place="margin">Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Biſhop.</note> whiles God ſanctifieth the honour, that is the preferment of him, vpon whom the biſhop in an aſſemblie with many prieſtes about him laieth his hande.</p>
                  <p>This Conſecration of the biſhop, with other biſhops, or prieſtes, Tertullian calleth <hi>Conſeſſum ordinis,</hi> the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of Order: and the Sanctification of God, is that which is geuen by the Sacrament of Prieſthod.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:12789:267"/> tranſlation? Speaketh not Tertullian of the action of a Prieſt? You meane by your miniſtring of your oblation, that the Prieſt miniſtreth to the people that thing, which the people offered to the prieſt. and ſo you make the people to offer bread vnto the prieſt, but the prieſt to offer nothing vnto God. But Tertullian ſaith the prieſt doth baptize, and doth offer, meaning that he offereth to God. But if your ſenſe be true, the people doth offer to the Prieſt, and not the prieſt vnto God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the prieſt doth not offer at al.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12789:268"/> then otherwiſe, and that euen in thoſe Churches, in ſome of which within the firſt fiue hundred yeres, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Aultare was geuen to children at their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. And yet M. Iewel can not ſaie, that this later cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is worſe then the firſt was, but rather that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the councel of Trent hath declared.</p>
                  <p>I demaunde then of any M. Iewels Predeceſſours in Sarisburie, euen til our Apoſtle S. Auguſtines time: but he ſkippeth ouer theſe laſt thowſand yeres, and aſketh me of that which was before. Whiche inequalitie not withſtanding, I anſwer to his queſtion, and ſaie, that al the Biſhops of Rome, as wel before S. Auguſtines time, as ſithence, mainteined our Religion. And that I proue, bicauſe the B. of Rome that now is, <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, doth allow our Religion. For we communicate with him, and he with vs. And this preſent Biſhop agreed with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, and he againe with <hi>Paulus</hi> the fourth. And ſo if we go vpward from man to man, from Pope, to Pope, euen vnto S. Gregories time: we ſhal find, that concerning any queſtion which is betwen the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and vs, there was neuer Pope yet, which diſagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his predeceſſours, or aftercommers. For euery one of them doth prayſe, and follow. S. Gregorie. Now S Gregorie ſent S. Auguſtine into England, who turned our Engliſh nation to the faith: and S. Gregorie him ſelfe agreed in ſaith with his predeceſſours, euen til we come to S. Peter. Neither can it be ſhewed, whiche Pope did euer breake, or change the vniuerſal faith, which was in Rome, or any where els before, concerning either priuate Maſſe, as you terme it, or any other Article.</p>
                  <p>If then Pius the fifth, or any Pope els do allow priuate
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:12789:268"/> Maſſe, as it is euident he doth, and the General Councel of Trent with him: certainely euery Pope before him did allow the ſame. For this Pope agreeth with his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. Or els if vntil S. Gregories time priuate Maſſe (in ſuch ſenſe as we now diſpute of it) had not ben heard of, being ſo hainous an offence againſt God, as that whereby the Inſtitution of Chriſtes ſupper is broken, which Pope ſo euer had begonne it, he ſhould haue ben noted for his new Inuention, as they haue ben, who haue begonne any change, as in certaine ceremonies ſome haue done.<note place="margin">Platina in vitis Pontifi.</note> For pope Sergius is noted to haue ben the firſt, that changed his former name: Leo the third was the firſt, that placed the empire in Fraunce and Germanie: and Hadrianus the third was the firſt, that chalenged to be pope without the Emperours authoritie, and ſo forth in many like matters.</p>
                  <p>But ſeing M. Iewel can name no man who beganne to ſaie, or allow priuate Maſſe, and yet ſeing it is ſaid and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thoroughout al Chriſtendom, it is S.

But that very ſelfe ſame facte of his is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient argument, both of their Violence, and of the hatred, that Liberius bore to the hereſie (of the Arians) and what his conſent, and opinion was concerning Athanaſius, at what time he had his deſires free, that is, when he might both ſpeake, and do freely, what ſemed to him moſt mete and expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in that cauſe.

                  <p>This <hi>Liberius</hi> then, although perhaps he ſubſcribed at the length, yet was there neuer good, or honeſt man, that euer would cal him an Arian, who in dede neuer loued the Arians, but abhorred their opinion.

Wel maie ſuch a forced ſubſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> argue the lacke of fortitude, certainely it proueth not hereſie. For an Heretike doth ſtubbornely defende his opinion. But
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:12789:277"/> 
                     <hi>Liberius</hi> was ſo farre from defending the Arian hereſie, that he could hardly with terrour of death after two yeres baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be forced, to put his hand vnto the booke againſt Athanaſius, which was in deede a derogation to the faith by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but directly it was not Arianiſme.</p>

Iewel here allegeth in great ſadneſſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this reported of Pope Leo that he was an Arian, in a ſpecial Legende written of Leo, but in a Legende of S. Hilarie of Poitiers in Fraunce, whoſe holy reliques the Huguenotes in their late vproares in Fraunce villanouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed, burned to Aſhes, and threw awaie, as likewiſe the boanes, and Reliques of S.

Et ipſe in dictis ſuis magnam habet obſcuritatem, &amp; profunditatem.</hi> Of ſuch geare the Reader may finde great ſtoare there, when ſo euer he is diſpoſed to lawgh.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs heare the Legende, or rather the Fable, by which it appeareth to M. Iewel, that Pope Leo was an Arian. Thus it is tolde word by word. <hi>Eo tempore Leo Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa haereticorum perfidia deprauatus, &amp;c.</hi> At that time Pope Leo corrupted with the falſe beleefe of Heretikes, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a Councel of al the biſhops. They being called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Hilarius</hi> came in amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt them not ſent for. Which thing when the Pope <hi>(Leo)</hi> hearde of, he commaunded, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould riſe vp vnto him, nor geue him place. When he was come in, the Pope ſaid vnto him. Arte thou <hi>Hilarius</hi> the Frenche man? I am not a Frenche man, quod he, but one of Fraunce. that is to ſay, I am not borne in Fraunce, I am a Biſhop of Fraunce. Then ſaid the Pope, If thou be Hilarie of Fraunce, I am the Biſhop of the Romaine See, and Iudge. Then ſaid <hi>Hilarius:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou be Leo (that is to ſay, Lion) yet thou arte not the Lion of the tribe of Iuda. And though thou ſitte as iudge, yet thou ſitteſt not in the Seate of Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. At that the Pope (Leo) aroſe with diſdaine, ſaying, Abide a while, til I come againe, and paie thee that thou deſerueſt. To whom <hi>Hilarius</hi> anſwered. If thou come
<pb facs="tcp:12789:279"/> not againe, who ſhal make anſwer vnto me in thy ſteede? I wil come againe by and by, quod he, and wil bring downe thy pride.</p>
                  <p>When the Pope was gonne to do the ſecrete buſines of nature, he died of a dyſenterie, and auoiding foorth at the Pryuey al his entrailes, he ended his life miſerably. In the meane ceaſon Hilarie ſeeing, that none woulde riſe vp vnto him, tooke pacience, and ſetting him ſelfe downe on the grownde, ſaied: <hi>Domini eſt terra.</hi> Our Lordes is the earth. And therewith the earth by the wil of God, whereon he ſate, lifted it ſelfe vp, and ſtoode vp equal with the ſeates of the other Biſhops. Hereupon when tidinges came that the Pope was dead miſerably, Hilarie aroſe, and confirmed al the Biſhoppes in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Faith, and ſo ſent them home. This is the wiſe Legende, by which it appeareth to M. Iewel, that Pope Leo was an Arian Heretique.</p>
                  <p>To let paſſe the other folies of this Fable, what a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is it to make Leo the Pope, and S. Hilarie the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Poitiers, thus to braule together at an aſſemblie of Biſhoppes, whereas it is moſt certaine, that S. Hilarie died at leaſt one hundred yeres, before Leo was borne? M. Iewel ſhould not ſo falſly haue conceeled, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth immediatly in the ſame Legende, whereby this tale is diſcredited. For thus ſaith the authour him ſelfe. <hi>Hoc autem miraculum de morte Leonis Papae dubitationem habet, tum quia historia Eccleſiaſtica, vel Tripartita nihil de hoc loquitur: tum quia aliquem Papam talis nominis tunc fuiſſe, Chronica non testatur: tum quia Hieronymus dicit, quòd Sancta Romana Eccleſia ſemper immaculata permanſit, &amp; in futuro manebit ſine Haereticorum in ſultatione.</hi> But of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:12789:279"/> this miracle of Leos death it is doubted, partly bicauſe neither the Eccleſiaſtical, nor the Tripartite ſtorie ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of it: partly bicauſe the Chronicle witneſſeth not, that there was any Pope then of that name:<note place="margin">S. Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie for the Churche of Rome out of his ovvne Doctor.</note> alſo bicauſe S. Hierome ſaith, that the holy Romaine Churche hath euer continued vnſpotted, and ſo ſhal continue for tyme to come, that Heretiques ſhal haue no cauſe to inſult at here. Marke M. Iewel, if your Legende be ought worth, with how cleare teſtimonie of S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, your imputing of Hereſie vnto the See of Rome is confuted.</p>
                  <p>After this by waie of gheaſſe, the Authour ſaith, to make a bad defence of the fables vanitie, wherein he ſheweth alſo his owne folie, and vanitie, that it might be ſayd (that is to witte, if a man would lye) that at that time there was ſome Pope ſo called, not canonically choſen, but ſet in by tyrannical intruſion. Whereas he feared this would not ſerue, he addeth an other gheaſſe, <hi>Vel fortè Liberius &amp;c.</hi> Or els perhappes (ſaith he) Pope <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> who fauoured Conſtantius the Heretique Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, was after an other name called Leo. Whiche al are very poore, and peeuiſh ſhiftes to ſooth the vaine fable of this Legende.</p>
                  <p>Suche Donghilles, and broken haies M. Iewel is faine to rake, and ſkrape, to finde ſome Ragges, wherewith to couer the fowle nakednes of his wretched cauſe. Yet the Storie ſet out in the name of Amphilochius, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching S. Baſiles miracles, is muche more probable, and maie beare the name of the text, where this Legende ſhal not be thought worthy the name of the Gloſe.</p>

For <hi>Honorius</hi> in deede fel into the hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites.</hi> But he fel into it, when as yet it was not euidently condemned by the Churche in any general Councel. He fel into it, but he defended it not: and yet the crime of hereſie is not properly incurred, without a ſtubborne defence of falſehod.</p>
                  <p>Againe, he did not only not make any heretical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, touching the defence of that hereſie, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:12789:280"/> of the See Apoſtolike, but rather as a publike perſon, he did reſiſt that hereſie.<note place="margin">Platina in Honorio.</note> For he induced <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi> the Emperour to banniſhe <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the Patriarke of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus the</hi> Patriarke of Alexandria, who were giltie of the Monothelite hereſie. How then ſtandeth it together, that <hi>Honorius</hi> did bothe fauour, and hate the ſelfe ſame hereſie?</p>
                  <p>Some men conſidering what he did, ſay, that he was falſly accuſed of the hereſie, but others thinke rather, that in his harte he fauoured the hereſie, yet bicauſe the Romaine Churche, to witte, the Biſſhoppes of <hi>Ostia,</hi> of <hi>Porto,</hi> of <hi>Preneste,</hi> of <hi>Velitro,</hi> of <hi>Sabini,</hi> and ſuche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that hauing their biſhoprikes neare there about, are moſte commonly reſident in Rome, or are moſte eaſily aſſembled thither to euery Conſiſtorie with a great number of Prieſtes, of Deacons, and of other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, who are the Councel,<note place="margin">Cypria. in epiſt. ad Clerum vib.

                  <pb facs="tcp:12789:281"/>
                  <p>But now conſider good Reader the worke of God, when he ſhould come to confirme his brethrene, that is to ſay, to doo any open thing, whereby the other Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes might be eſtabliſhed in their faith: then was he conſtrained to doo that, whiche might edifie, and not hinder the true faith, that God might be iuſtified in his woordes,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>For when <hi>Honorius</hi> came to this pointe, whether in publike Conſiſtorie the Monothelite hereſie (whiche taught, that there was but one wil in Chriſte) ſhould be allowed or no! then, as Platina recordeth, the Pope infourmed the Emperour, as wel by letters, as by meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſangers, that Chriſte had two willes: and that was done by the common aſſemblie, and the letters went, as the deede of the See, and Churche of Rome: whereas in the meane time <hi>Honorius</hi> was of an other minde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him ſelfe. And they that are about great perſonages knowe right wel, that they doo many times ſende ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meſſages, and letters, through the aduiſe of their Councel, whiche the greate perſonages them ſelues would not haue to take place. Thus we ſee a double perſon in him that gouerneth: one, which he hath in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of his owne priuate minde, and iudgement, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he hath, or rather taketh as put vpon him, by the publike office, which he beareth.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the matter of Succeſsion, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perſon is only to be regarded, which in Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> was Catholike. For that is the perſonage, whiche may
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:12789:281"/> hurte, or hinder the Church. Of that publike perſonage Pope <hi>Agatho,</hi> who followed not long after <hi>Honorius,</hi> doubted not to write, as it is recited in the ſixth general Councel <hi>Act. 4.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Concil. 6. General. Act. 4.</note> concerning this very hereſie of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites.

Thus the predeceſſours of <hi>Agatho,</hi> emong whom <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> was one, did, as he reporteth, alwaies openly defende the Catholique faith againſt the Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</p>
                  <p>It is to men knowen perhaps ſometimes, that the Pope, or prince leadeth an euil life, as for example, in fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in Aduouterie. Yet ſo long as their lawes forbid
<pb facs="tcp:12789:282"/> them bothe, the menne are of euil example, but the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are good and holeſom, and the common Weale is wel prouided for.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:12789:293"/> commeth in by preſsing, commeth not in by Succeſsion. Nay contrarywiſe, Succeſsion is the chiefe way for any Chriſtian man to auoide Antichriſt. For he that remaineth in that faith, whiche came lineally, and by Biſhop after Biſhop from the Apoſtles, he is ſure of his enheritance, and needeth not to feare, leſt he obey Antichriſt.

But he that keepeth him ſelfe in the chiefe Succeſsion, ſhalbe ſure not to fal from faith. And good reaſon why. For Antichriſt commeth in to breake order: yea rather the Deuil breaketh the order of Chriſtes Church, to prepare a waie for Antichriſt. For if al menne keepe them ſelues in one faith, and Doctrine, when ſoeuer Antichriſt ſhould preache againſt that, he ſhould be detected, and knowen vnto al menne. But now when there are ſo many beleefes in the world, why may not Antichriſte gete a companie to follow him, as wel as other Archeheretiques doo? He therefore that once changeth his faith, except he returne from whence he went, can not tel in what Church he is, and whether it be Antichriſtes Churche, or no. But he that keepeth that, whiche was from the beginning, he is ſure to holde that faith, againſt which Antichriſte muſt ſtriue, and fighte.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore S. Iohn ſpeaking of Antichriſt, ſaith thus: <hi>Vos quod audiſtis ab initio, in vobis permaneat.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, he corrupteth S. Cyprian, in putting in, <hi>meis,</hi> for <hi>noſtra,</hi> my predeceſſours, in ſtede of our predeceſſours. For S. Cyprian ſpeaketh not of his owne Succeſsion, but of what ſoeuer Prieſt, or Biſhoppe, that liued before his time. Againe, S. Cyprian ſpake not of any ſuch cuſtome, as had ben generally vſed of al Biſhops, for then it had ben of ful authoritie: but of that, which ſome one man vſed priuatly, and without keeping the lawe of Succeſsion. And therefore S. Cyprian ſaid, <hi>Si quis,</hi> if any man. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the thing he ſpake of, was, that ſome were ſaid to offer water alone in our Lordes ſupper, and not wine withal. Now ſaith he, if any before our time haue vſed to offer water, and not wine mingled with water, wel he may be pardoned by our Lordes mercie: but we that are admoniſhed, and inſtructed to offer our Lordes chalice mingled with wine, that is to ſay, conſiſting not of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone, but of water and wine mingled together: we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be pardoned, except we mingle water with wine, and ſo do offer our Lordes Chalice, as he him ſelfe did offer it.</p>

He in deede was no Heretike. For although he falſely beleued an vntruth, and earneſtly taught, that thoſe, who had ben baptized of Heretiques, if they came to the vnitie of the Catholike Churche, ſhould be baptized, as hauing before no true ſacrament of Baptiſme, yet he proteſted many times, that he iudged no man, that thought, or taught the contrarie.<note place="margin">Cyprianus In epiſt. ad Iubatanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp; contra Epiſt.

                  <p>Notwithſtanding, whiles he defended his errour, he was deceiued in that Principle, which now you allowe. For whereas Pope <hi>Stephanus,</hi> knowing, that by Succeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vſe of the only laying of handes vpon them that had ben baptized of heretikes, without baptizing them a new, was deriued from the Apoſtles, and receiued generally euen in Afrike it ſelfe, vntil <hi>Agrippinus</hi> a Biſhop of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage before S. Cyprian brake it: whereas Pope <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> I ſay, knowing this, decreed, that <hi>nothing ſhould be changed, or be taken vp a new:</hi> S. Cyprian not being able to denie the tradition, whereof Pope Steuen ſpake, and which S. Cyprians predeceſſour <hi>Agrippinus</hi> firſt beganne to change, fled to this common place, that the worde of God was againſt the cuſtome, and therefore the cuſtome ought to be broken.</p>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:12789:298"/> Then ſaid S.

For your ſelfe I trow, wil not allow, that they ſhould be baptized againe in your owne Churche, that haue ben before baptized in an other Churche, which ye accompte for falſe, heretical, or ſchiſmatical. What meant you then to conſecrate S. Cyprians errour, and to allege his authoritie therein, where it ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and allowed?

When is he looſed? Of whom is he looſed? What thinges ye looſe in earth (ſaith he) they ſhalbe looſed alſo in heauen. This Abſolution is made by the Prieſt.

                     <p>But if this Defender preſſe vs with Chryſoſtome, we anſwer that though Chryſoſtom graunte, that a married man may aſcende to the holy ſeate, yet he ſayeth not, that a man may deſcend from that holy ſeate to the Bride bedde.

<pb facs="tcp:12789:308"/> the other, if any man haue taken holy Orders. The firſt I proue by Scripture, and the Fathers: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by the Ordinance of the Churche, and alſo by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the Fathers. Then I anſwer to the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged out of S.

After this, graunting that in the olde Church married men vpon good cauſes were made Biſhops, I denie, that Biſhoppes were euer made married men, after they were Biſhops.</p>

Fourthly, that in olde time Biſhoppes were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after they had once ben conſecrate Biſhops.

                  <p>Of his owne in manner he ſaith nothing, but thus, Origen ſaith, Tertullian ſaith, ſuche a one ſaith, and ſuche an
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:12789:308"/> other ſaith, and he ſaith, and againe he ſaith, &amp;c. Then he laith downe their Latine, be it true, be it falſe, and putteth a tranſlation vnto it, ſuche, as becommeth ſhifters to vſe in a falſe matter, and thus furniſheth out a great booke, that the worlde may thinke, he is a great Clerke.</p>
                  <p>Were al that he allegeth to the purpoſe, then were it ſomewhat, yet were it no great commendation, to make bookes onely out of Notebookes already made, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to his handes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt (to declare his order) keeping him ſelfe a luffe of,<note place="margin">M Iewels order in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this pointe, and his tvvo princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> and comming nothing neare the point, wherein my Confutation conſiſteth, he bringeth the holy Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuſpicion of not dealing vprightly and indifferently herein, bearing the Reader in hande, they haue ſwarued from truth, <hi>either in the auauncing of Virginitie, or els in the diſgracing of lawful Matrimonie.</hi> To make proufe of this, he allegeth no ſmal number of ſentences out of certaine Fathers, in whiche not being thoroughly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they ſeeme to ſpeake hardly of Marriage, ſpecially of the ſecond Mariage. For this point his Doctours be theſe, Tertullian in <hi>Exhortatione ad Caſtitatem:</hi> the author of the vnperfite worke vpon S.

                  <p>Nexte, he reckeneth vp ſo many menne, as he hath read of, that being Married, were afterwardes made Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. Of whom he ſaith, <hi>that they vſed Mariage them ſelues in their owne perſonnes,</hi> which is more then he is liable to proue, if by vſe of Marriage, he meane the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal copulation.</p>

                     <note place="margin">M.

                  <p>Now to ſay ſomewhat to his Principles, before I come to his Anſwer, were it true, that certaine Fathers ſpeaking of Matrimonie, vſed <hi>immoderate, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſpeaches,</hi> for ſo he termeth them: Againe, that many of them had ben married before they came to be Biſhops: what perteineth that to the defence of the marriage of Votaries, and Prieſtes, whiche was the point preſently treated of? What, wil he make this fonde and childiſh Argument, Certaine Fathers ſpake ouer veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Matrimonie, <hi>Item,</hi> ſome of them were called to the dignitie of Biſhops, from the ſtate of married menne: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Prieſtes, Monkes, Friers, and Nonnes, who haue vowed Chaſtitie, may lawfully marrie wiues, and take huſbandes?

And of what ſmal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this reaſon is, the verieſt Cobblers of al their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, if they can reade any Engliſh beſides their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

                  <p>Touching the Fathers ſpeaches in reproufe of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, one anſwer M. Iewel,<note place="margin">Anſvver to M.

And S. Hierome witneſſeth (as Beatus Rhenanus noteth) that booke to haue ben written againſt the Churche. Now we thinke not our ſelues bounde to defende, what ſo euer they ſay, whom the Churche condemneth for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques.

                  <p>As concerning the other Fathers by you alleged, the thing, for which they ſeeme ſometimes to ſpeake of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie not fauorably, is the immoderate concupiſcence or luſte now after ſinne by our firſt parentes committed, which is of the holy Fathers reported to be <hi>malum,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much to ſay, an euil thing, and to procede not of God, but of ſinne, without which euil thing, the thing, that is good in Matrimonie, that is to ſay, generation, can not be perfourmed.</p>
                  <p>This, beſides other Fathers S. Auguſtine calleth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, <hi>malum,</hi> an euil thing, as <hi>carnalis concupiſcentiae malum,</hi> the euil of fleſhly luſte, and <hi>malum libidinis,</hi> the euil thing of carnal pleaſure, &amp;c. He ſaith that natural
<pb facs="tcp:12789:310"/> ſhamefaſtneſſe ſheweth it ſo to be, by whiche it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that although married perſonnes glorie in Children, yet when they attend vpon the worke of begeting Children, they chooſe them ſelues ſecrete places, and wil al witneſſes to be out of their waie, thereby confeſsing the ſhamefaſtneſſe it ſelfe of Nature.

                  <p>Neither proceedeth this euil thing of Marriage, but of ſinne,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſal. <hi>70.</hi>
                     </note> and it is the paine of ſinne. In married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnes it is euil, but no ſinne, <hi>malum poenae,</hi> not <hi>malum culpae,</hi> as the Scholaſtical Diuines cal it. And this is the meaning of that ſaying of the authour that wrote the vnperfite worke vppon S. Matthew,<note place="margin">Opere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecto in Matth.

But he meaneth the coniunction of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with his wife in the acte of generation. Neither yet vnderſtandeth he the coniunction or acte it ſelfe, in wedlocke to be an euil thing (ſo it be not to the end to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:12789:310"/> ſaciate luſte and pleaſure, but to the ende to begete a childe, that being againe begotten and regenerate, may ſerue to fil the Citie of God, as S.

That diuers and ſundry married menne were for their vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life made Biſhops, I denie not, ne neuer yet denied. You allege al the examples of antiquitie that you can, yet not ſo much as one to the purpoſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Ouer againſt theſe my wordes, you haue placed in the margent of your booke, this note with your ſtarre.<note place="margin">Defence. pag. 163.</note> 
                     <hi>Vntruthes, two together, as better appeareth by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare.</hi> By which you charge my ſaying with two Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes. Of ſuch notes your booke hath great ſtoare. But God be thanked, the world ſeeth, you are ryfer of vpbraidinges, and ſclaunders, then of ſubſtantial proufes. Nowe by your note you haue bounde your ſelfe to ſhewe vs, that it is lawful to marrie after the Vowe of Chaſtitie, likewiſe alſo after the holy Orders taken.</p>
                  <p>Before you came to proue either of theſe two pointes, you tel vs, that the Prieſtes of England were neuer Votaries, that is to ſay, that they neuer made Vow of ſingle life, and chaſtitie, whereby to binde them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues not to marrie. Neuer is a long daie M. Iewel. Wel, be it, as it is. If they be not Votaries, they may marrie ſay you. But anſwer directly to the point I pray you.<note place="margin">M. Ievvel ful coldly maketh that but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> May they marrie, who haue vowed chaſtitie? Say yea, or nay. <hi>VVee graunte,</hi> ſay you, <hi>it is reaſon, and conuenient, that who ſo hath made a Vowe vnto God, ſhould keepe his promiſe.</hi> This is ſomewhat, though it be coldely ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>But yet you muſt come nearer vnto the point. You ſpeake generally, and faintly. We ſpeake not of a Vowe, or promiſe in general. If a man make a promiſe to an other man, it is reaſon, and conuenient, that he keepe it. But how ſaie you to the vow of chaſtitie, deliberatly made, of man, or woman to God? Is it in any wiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to perfourme it, or no? If it be neceſſary, why
<pb facs="tcp:12789:317"/> ſpeake ye ſo coldly, <hi>it is reaſon, and conuenient?</hi> What meane you by your <hi>reaſon and conuenience?</hi> Is it any more, but that if a Moncke, or a Frier feele him ſelfe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with luſte, he ſhal by and by take a woman vnder pretenſe of Wedlocke, and ſo quenche heate? that your Nonnes alſo, if they beginne to be wanton, ſhal take huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes, and ſo mortifie the luſtes of their fleſh? For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the perfourmance of the Vow but a matter of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and conuenience, ye ſeeme eaſily to diſpenſe with their marriages in caſe of hote, and vrgent temptations. For ſo men are wont to diſpenſe with that which ſemeth reaſonable and conuenient, when a greater reaſon ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to moue them to the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>But let vs leaue your ſaying to your owne conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.<note place="margin">The Fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and chiefe maiſters of this nevv Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are iudged vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by M. I. him ſelfe.</note> By the ſame this much you graunte at the leaſt, that ſo many of your Goſpel, as haue broken their Vow of Chaſtitie, and haue married, haue don otherwiſe, then was conuenient, and agreable to reaſon. Thus ye make the Founder of your Religion Frier Luther, an vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man. Such was Oecolampadius, ſuch was Bucer, ſuch was Peter Martyr, ſuch were in manner al the reſte of your fleſhly Prelates, Teachers, Preachers, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who being Religious by taking Yokefelowes vnto them, haue broken their Vow and promiſe to God.</p>
                  <p>I canne you thanke M. Iewel for graunting this muche, althoughte it be too litle. Mary to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, I doubte not, it ſeemeth too muche. And litle thanke doubteleſſe ſhal you haue at their handes for it. For the breache of their Vowe being graunted to be againſt reaſon, and a thing inconuenient, how ſhal Gods people beleeue, their doctrine to be reaſonable, and their
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:12789:317"/> liues to be conuenient? Sure I am that neither Luther him ſelfe, nor Bucer, nor Peter Martyr, nor any of the reſte, could euer be perſuaded to acknowledge, and confeſſe ſo much. And were they now a liue, they would be offended with you for ſo ſaying. And how your good married brothers of England wil like you for it, I doubte, for aſmuch at it is not for their profite, the people ſhould vnderſtand, that by your owne confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Preachers, and ſpiritual Gouernours (ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as were profeſſed in any Religion, for certaine it is that they be Votaries) by taking wiues haue done the thing, that is inconuenient, and al together againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. What a hainous crime it is to contemne the vow of Chaſtitie, and to breake promiſe with God, it may be declared in an other place. Here onely we take that you confeſſe your ſelfe, that it is againſt reaſon, and not conuenient.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſaying you allege out of the third booke of Cyrillus in Leuiticum,<note place="margin">Forgerie.</note> it can ſerue you to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to witneſſe your forgerie, and falſhoode. For there is no ſuch ſaying in that booke. If any man be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to breake his vowe vpon warrant of thoſe wordes, you are gilty of the crime.</p>
                  <p>If the Prieſtes of England be no Votaries, as you ſay, yet what ſay you to the Prieſtes of other countries? Is it lawful for them of Germanie, Fraunce, Italie, Spaine, and of other landes, who haue made the vow of chaſtitie, to marrie? That it is not lawful, I haue ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in my Confutation. For the Scriptures be plaine, that a Vowe made to God, is to be perfourmed. Neither wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led I that which I ſaid in my Confutation, to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded
<pb facs="tcp:12789:318"/> of your felowes of England onely. How excuſe you then your brethren of other Countries,<note place="margin">VVhat hath M. Ievvel to ſay in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries mari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ages in o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des beſides England?</note> that firſte gaue the onſet, and aduentured to ſet your Goſpel a broche? What ſay you for Luther, for Peter Martyr your owne good frende and Maiſter, and for many ſuch others, who were not onely Prieſtes, but alſo Religious menne, and feared not to yoke them ſelues in pretenſed marriage vnto Nonnes? If they did wickedly therein, as no man lyuing can excuſe them, how is not your Goſpel builded vpon an euil foundation? But this is too large a fielde at this preſent, for vs to walke in. I looke ſtil, when you wil come to the point, that requireth your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>As for the Prieſtes of England, what moueth you to ſay, they be no Votaries? What priuiledge haue they aboue al other Prieſtes of Chriſtendome, at leaſt of the Latine,<note place="margin">That prie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gland be Votaties.</note> and Weſt Churche? Who euer ſaid it? Who euer wrote it? Where euer found you it? Or if any where it be found (which I trow ye ſhal neuer be hable to ſhew in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny authentical writer) what reaſon hath the reporter for it? O ſay you, <hi>it is knowen, and confeſſed.</hi> But your word M. Iewel is no Goſpel. Your bare affirmation is of ſmal credite. If ye haue no better proufe for it, and ye wil doo by my reade, in caſe you be a Prieſt, be not ouer haſty to take a Yokefelow yet, as your companions haue don. For ſurely not withſtanding your maruelous knowledge, and bold confeſsion, you are like to proue deceiued. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry if you be no Prieſt, as I can not tel what to make of you, then go to it, and God ſend you better lucke, then ſome of your felowes haue had.</p>
                  <p>For proufe that Prieſtes of England are Votaries, this
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:12789:318"/> is moſt certaine, that the Vowe of Chaſtitie is annexed vnto holy Orders by ſtatute of holy Churche, and that with moſt conuenient reaſon the Church hath ordeined,<note place="margin">The vovv of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed vnto holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> that al from a Biſhop to a Subdeacon, ſhal vowe Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Which thing the Grecians alſo admitted, though not vniuerſally. For although they marrie not after holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders receiued, yet they vſe matrimonie before holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders contracted. Wherfore there is no doubte, but euery man that taketh holy Orders, be he of England, or of what countrie ſoeuer in the weſt Church, promiſeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> that is to ſay, by the very taking it ſelfe of Orders, whether he expreſſe it in wordes, or holde his peace.</p>
                  <p>That the vowe of Chaſtitie is required at the taking of holy Orders, we haue theſe plaine wordes of <hi>S.</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie,<note place="margin">The vovve of Chaſtitie required at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſhip.</note> by whoſe procurement our Engliſh nation was conuerted to the Faith, and at whoſe handes the Church of England receiued al order and inſtitution neceſſarie to Chriſtian life: <hi>Nullum Subdiaconum facere praeſumant Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopi, niſi qui ſe victurum caſtè promiſerit.</hi> Let Biſhops not preſume to make any Subdeacon, onleſſe he promiſe to liue in chaſtitie.

Sir, when I was made Prieſt, I made no vowe,<note place="margin">Vovv of Chaſtitie made in facte, though no vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be ſpoken.</note> nor promiſed at al to liue the ſingle life: For I ſaid nothing to the biſhop that laid handes vpon me, and he required no ſuch thing of me. How am I then a Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? And why may I not marrie? To whom I anſwer, you tooke this charge vpon you, before you came to be made Prieſt, when you tooke Subdeaconſhip. For that is the firſt among the holy Orders. Vnto which for ſo much as the vowe of Chaſtitie by common Tradition, by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſtatute and ordinance of the Church, is annexed, in taking that Order, you hounde your ſelfe <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Promiſes other, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Grauntes, made in deede vvithout vvorde.</note> in fact it ſelfe, to that condition, which thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth. For Vowes, Promiſes, Othes, Grauntes, and ſuch other the like, may be made, and profeſſed by facte and dede, though wordes of vowing, promiſing, ſwearing, or graunting be not expreſſed. Many a man that marrieth a wife, doth not tel her before, or at the time of marriage with expreſſe wordes, that he wil loue her, cheriſh her,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:12789:320"/> keepe, defend, and mainteine her, render wedlocke due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto her, &amp;c: Yet in that he marrieth her, al theſe he is bounde to performe, as being vnderſtanded to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the condition of marriage, and hath promiſed no leſſe by taking her to wife. And if being required of the wiſe to render theſe dueties vnto her, he refuſe, and ſay, nay wife, thou ſhalt pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, I neuer made thee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to do this much for thee: may not ſhe ſay againe, why husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, you haue married me, and that is promiſe ynough?</p>
                  <p>The partie that taketh an Othe, commonly ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but by laying his hande vpon a booke, and by kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the booke, or, as the cuſtome is in ſome countries, by holding vp his two forefingers, geueth his conſent, and proteſteth to doo that is included in the condition of the othe. Some time menne geue conſent to a thing, not by ſpeaking ought at al, but by going vnto a ſide: which of the olde Romaines was termed, <hi>pedibus ire in ſententia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>

                  <p>The Souldier<note place="margin">Souldier.</note> by taking his badge, and yelding his name to be booked, which is a deede, though he ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, promiſeth, and ſo farre forth bindeth him ſelfe, to obey his Captaine, and to abide the fortune of warre. The Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles in old time, that receiued Circunciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who were called, <hi>Proſelyti,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Proſelyti.</note> by that very facte, made Vowe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to perfourme what Moyſes law required, though they ſaid nothing. And many a Chriſtian man in the time, when the faith was perſecuted by heathen Tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, made promiſe, and profeſsion of Idolatrie,<note place="margin">Thurifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</note> onely by caſting a litle frankencenſe into the Fier, when they vttered no wordes of Idolatrie at al. Many other ſuch exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples might here eaſily be reherſed, by which it is declared, that a man in ſome caſes voweth, promiſeth, and profeſſeth a thing,
<pb facs="tcp:12789:321"/> good or euil, in acte and deede, where wordes of Vowe, promiſe, or profeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not ſpoken. And to this ſenſe the common Engliſh prouerbe (if it may be applied to ſo ſad a matter) leadeth vs: <hi>As good is a becke, as a Dieu garde,</hi> wherby is meant a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent,<note place="margin">Vovv of Chaſtitie made in ſilence. <hi>Concil.

                  <p>But what neede I to proue this by examples? The plaine texte of the tenth Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the moſt auncient Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Ancyra aboue reherſed, putteth this matter out of doubte. Where it is ſaid of Deacons, that if, when they receiued the Biſhops laying on of hand vpon them, they required not licence to marrie, but helde their peace, thereby (<hi>profeſsi continentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> be the wordes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel) hauing vowed, promiſed, or profeſſed to continew in Chaſtitie: in caſe afterward they married, they ſhould geue ouer the holy miniſterie. Lo there by taking the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order only, without wordes of a Vowe expreſſed, the promiſe and Vow of Chaſtitie is by thoſe learned Fathers pronounced to be made. Neither is the partie, that after holy Orders taken marrieth, excuſed by that he ceaſeth from the miniſterie. The ceſſation from the miniſterie, is a pouniſhement in the courte of man: there remaineth to ſuch a one an other pouniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the courte of God, for his breache of promiſe. Thus it is cleere, that the Prieſtes of England were Votaries, as wel as other Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes of the Latine Church be, which M. Iewel only vpon warrant of his owne auctoritie denieth.</p>
                  <p>Sith then it is ſo Reader, that M. Iewel keepeth him ſelfe a luffe of, and wil not come to the point, wherein the controuerſie lyeth, not being hable in deede to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the marriage of them that haue taken holy Orders, or otherwiſe haue made Vow of Chaſtitie: I thinke it good
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:12789:321"/> here briefly to reherſe the ſumme of his allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath blotted ſo much paper about this matter.<note place="margin">The ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of M. Ievvels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations for proufe of prieſtes marriages</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hauing denied the Prieſtes of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be Votaries, he bringeth in ſayinges of Fathers, reporting that Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is a harde thing, and that it is not in our choiſe, but the mere gifte of God. Which thing as it maketh nothing to the preſent purpoſe, ſo I graunte to be true. We ought not to chooſe that ſtate of life, but vpon good trial of our ſelues. But when we haue taken that yoke vpon vs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth vs to pray for the aſsiſtance of Gods grace, and to vſe al ſuche good meanes, by whiche we may atteine helpe towardes the perfourmance of our promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Then he allegeth other ſayinges counſeling thoſe, that either can not, or wil not keepe Chaſtitie, to take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, that God hath ordeined, that is to ſay, to marrie. Which counſel is vnderſtanded to be geuen vnto them, that haue made no Vow at al to the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>After this he bringeth in certaine teſtimonies ſpeaking in fauour (as they ſeeme) of marriage after a Vow of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, taken out of S. Cyprian, S. Auguſtine, Epiphanius, S. Hierome. In al which places thoſe holy Fathers are to be vnderſtanded to ſpeake of them, that haue made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or ſimple Vow, as they terme it, and not a Solemne Vow. Neither doo they allow ſuch marriages ſimply,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bonifac. 8. in c. vnico. de voto. in 6.</hi> The deter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mination of the Churche, in vvhat caſe of a Vovve made mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, in vvhat caſe it holdeth not. For vvhat reaſon marriage holdeth in the caſe of a Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Vovv, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe in the caſe of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Vovve.</note> but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of a woorſe iniquitie. The matrimonie of ſuch, is not to be diſſolued, yet is the breache of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a mortal ſinne. Now ſo it is by determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, that a Sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Vow is made at the profeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any approued Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and at the taking of holy Orders, and by whom ſuch Vow is made, they may not go backe to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, neither if they marrie, doth that marriage holde, but
<pb facs="tcp:12789:322"/> is taken for none. In the caſe of a ſimple Vowe, marriage ſtandeth for good, and may not be diſſolued, albeit the partie who Vowed, and promiſed the contrarie, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting marriage, as I ſaid ſinneth mortally.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon hereof is this. In a Simple Vowe there is made but a bare Promiſe, and the dominion of the thing which is promiſed, remaineth ſtil with him that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. But in a Solemne Vowe, there is not onely a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but alſo a deliuerie made of the thing that is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, aſmuche to ſay, of him ſelfe, and ſo there is alſo an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, and a poſſeſsion to the intereſt of Chriſt taken of the Churches part. This is the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt both. And it is a thing natural, and apperteining to the lawe of al nations, that a bare promiſe be of leſſe efficacie, then the exhibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſurrendre, and deliuerie of Poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the thing that is promiſed. He that hath promiſed one a howſe, or a portion of Lande, hath not yet taken away from him ſelfe the dominion of the thing. Wherefore if afterward he make deliuerie of it to an other, the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhal ſtand for good. Yet to the other he is bounde to make recompenſe, which commonly is iudged to be the valour of the thing promiſed. And he that hath now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto an other a howſe, or Lande, hath altogether depriued him ſelfe of the dominion thereof, neither can he now geue it to an other, as being an others thing.</p>
                  <p>The caſe is like in the Vowe of Chaſtitie, which is a certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracte betwen man and God. And reaſon it is, that what we acknowlege ourſelues bound to perfourme vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a worldly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract, we be bound to perfourme no leſſe vnto God in this ſpiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracte. The bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to God differeth much from the exhibiting:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:12789:322"/> and therfore if after a ſimple Vow of Chaſtitie, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in promiſe only, a man deliuer his body to another, which thing is done by Matrimonie: the deliuerie ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth firme and good. But if he geue vp alſo his owne body to keepe chaſtitie vnto God, and by entring into ſome Religion, or by taking Orders: now he can not diſpoſe of it otherwiſe, as not being in his dominion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if he attempt it, ſhal it ſtand for good. This muche touching the diuerſitie of a Simple, and Solemne Vow, I thought neceſſary to be ſaid in this place.</p>
                  <p>This much being weighed, and conſidered, it muſt appeare certaine, that the places, which M. Iewel alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of S. Auguſtine, affirming the mariages of ſuch as marrie after the Vow of chaſtitie, to be true mariages, and to be ſuch, as may not be diſſolued: are truly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded of mariages contracted in the caſe of a Simple Vowe, and not of a Solemne Vowe. Howſoeuer a man, or a woman make a Vowe to liue the ſingle life, chaſte and continent, and do not ſolemnize the ſame, either by entring into ſome Religion, or by taking holy Orders: if not withſtanding the Vow they preſume to marrie, the marriage holdeth. But if they marrie after they haue ſolemnized their Vowe by entring into Religion, or by taking holy Orders: the marriage is none at al,<note place="margin">M.

                  <p>A man would thinke, if this wil not ſerue the turne, that nothing wil ſerue. A bleſſed man Eupſychius, biſhop of Caeſaria, a holy Martyr, married to a wiſe but a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Martyrdome. The writer of the Storie <hi>Caſsiodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> a noble man, and graue Senator of Rome, a man of good credite. What can a man deſire more?

                  <p>The truth is good Reader, Neither Caſsiodorus wrote thus, nor Eupſychius was euer Biſhop of Caeſaria, nor of any other place, nor ſo much as a Prieſt, Deacon, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon. The writer of the Storie which we haue of this bleſſed Martyr Eupſychius, is Sozomenus the Greeke. Who with the Eccleſiaſtical Storie of Socrates, and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoritus, was tranſlated into Latine by one Epiphanius Scholaſticus. out of whiche three Caſsiodorus gathered

                  <p>Here is no mencion made, that <hi>Eupſychius</hi> was the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Caeſaria.

It is to be knowen, that Marriage is then forbidden, when it is taught, that a man hauing no impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in his owne perſon, or when there is no impediment in the perſon, whom he would take, is yet forbidden to marrie: as if Marriage of it ſelfe were il, or, as if it were an il thing in it ſelfe, a man to marrie.</p>
                  <p>There is impediment, as of blould, as betwen brother and ſiſter, ſo of Solemne Vow, and of Religion, as betwen a Prieſt and a Nonne, or any other woman. And as S. Paul doth allow the impediment of bloude, counting him a great ſinner, who had his fathers wife:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> ſo doth he allow the impediment of a vow, when he ſaith, that the yong widowes (if they ſhould be receiued into the number of thoſe chaſt perſons, whom the Churche vſed to feede) were like to haue damnation, bicauſe they would deſire
<pb facs="tcp:12789:346"/> to marie, and ſo would in harte at the leaſt breake their former faith, or promiſe of perpetual Chaſtitie. But (ſaith he) <hi>let yonge widowes marrie,</hi>

                     <hi>and bring forth children.</hi> As who ſhould ſaie: If they were receiued into the ſolemne number of Widowes, then they ſhould make promiſe not to marrie: and that promiſe perhaps they would breake, if not openly, yet in hart.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is no Deuils doctrine to teache, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hauing once vowed, can not marrie: bicauſe he him ſelfe geueth the impediment, and not the lawe of the Churche. For that lawe was in S. Paules time, as I now haue ſhewed after S. Chryſoſtoms minde.

                  <p>Now bicauſe the ſenſual appetite deliteth vs, and ſo ouercommeth vs commonly, more or leſſe: therefore it is called the law of the fleaſh, or the law, which the fleaſh would gladly follow, and obey: which law, or concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, leadeth vs priſoners to ſinne, ſo much as lieth in

                  <p>But the point of the queſtion is, whether it be truly and in deed a ſinne in vs, although we conſent not vnto it. We ſaie, it is not properly ſinne. M.

                  <p>Concupiſcence is in my fleaſh onely, and not in my minde, except I conſent vnto it, and ſo take it into my minde, and then in truth it is a ſinne.

                  <p>My reaſon to proue, that Chriſtes wordes are meant properly, is the perpetual interpretation of the auncient Fathers, the ſenſe and cuſtome of the Churche. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with Tertullian, he ſaith in this wiſe: <hi>Caro ablui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, vt anima emaculetur. Caro vngitur, vt anima conſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Caro ſignatur, vt &amp; anima muniatur. Caro manus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitione adumbratur, vt &amp; anima ſpiritu illuminetur.

The fleſh is annointed, that the ſoule may be conſecrated. The fleſh is ſignified, that the ſoule may be fenced. The fleſh is ſhadowed with the laying on of handes,<note place="margin">The fleſh is the meane, vvhereby the grace of God paſſeth vnto the ſoule.</note> that the ſoule alſo may be lightened with the holy Ghoſt. The fleſh is fed with the body and bloude of Chriſte, that the ſoule alſo may be made fat of God.</p>
                  <p>In theſe wordes, as diuers Sacramentes are ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo herein they agree al, that the fleſh is the meane, by which the grace of God paſſeth to the ſoule. As ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Baptiſme the fleſh is waſhed, that the ſoule may
<pb facs="tcp:12789:366"/> be cleanſed: ſo in the Sacrament of the Aulter, the fleſh is fed with the body and bloude of Chriſt, that the ſoule may be nouriſhed with the godhead, which dwelleth in that fleſhe. It is then to be noted, that the fleſhe eateth not material bread and wine, but the body and bloud of Chriſt. For as the thing, wherewith we are waſhed, is water, and that wherewith we are anointed is oile: euen ſo that, wherewith the fleſh is fed, is the body and bloud of Chriſt. The inſtrument therefore of Gods grace is none other in the Supper, beſide that fleſh, wherein the fulneſſe of the Godhed dwelleth.</p>
                  <p>It is wel knowen, that our fleſh hath no faith to eate Chriſtes body withal. Therefore when our fleſh is ſaid to be fed with Chriſtes body, it is clearly meant, that our fleſh is alſo really fed, with Chriſtes owne ſubſtance, as it is waſhed with water. And as by water touching our fleſh, cleannes cometh to our ſoule, euen ſo by the body of Chriſt touching our fleſh, the fatnes of God (ſo Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaketh) that is to ſaie, the plentiful grace of God, commeth to our ſoule.<note place="margin">

                  <p>By faith we might feede of the Godhead, but by that meanes onely we ſhould not be made partakers of the godhead as by the beſt meane.

Nam qui ſic redemptoris ſui ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem accepit, vt imitari paſsionem illius nec dum velit, in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no poſte ſanguinem poſuit.</hi> What the bloud of the Lambe is, ye haue now learned, not by hearing, but by drinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. This bloud is put vpon both the poſtes, when it is receiued not onely by the mouth of the body, but alſo
<pb facs="tcp:12789:368"/> by the mouth of the ſoule. For the bloud of the Lambe is put vpon both poſtes, when the Sacrament of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is both receiued by mouth for our redemption, and is alſo erneſtly thought vpon in the minde, for imitation. For he that ſo receiueth the bloud of his Sauiour with this minde, that he is not yet willing to folow his Paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: hath put the bloud but vpon one poſte.</p>
                  <p>The very ſame bloud which is receiued with the mouth of the hart, is alſo expreſſely taught, to be receiued with the mouth of the body. It is not therefore bread, that entreth into the mouth of the body, and it is the fleſh of Chriſt, that entreth into the hart. But the ſelfe ſame thing, which the hart feedeth on, entreth in at the mouth. Theſe are ſuch teſtimonies, that can neuer be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided by any Anſwere, and at this preſent they may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for this controuerſie of the Real Preſence.

                     </hi> as though they were Heathens, that profeſſe the faith, which is taught in the ſchoole of Chriſt. It was truly an heathniſh interpretation of yours.</p>
                  <p>But that very place of S.

Thou art come hither, thou haſt ſonge an hymne, in this thy facte, that thou didſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte with the vnworthie, thou haſt confeſſed thy ſelfe with al the reſt, to be one of them, that are worthie. Wherefore then doeſt thou not participate of this table, ſeing thou remaynedſt behinde?</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, it was the cuſtome for the faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be preſent at the myſteries, and to ſtand by, though they receiued not the communion. And albeit S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom reproueth them fot not communicating, yet he doth not excommunicate them, as breaking the order of the Church in tarying. And yet if there had ben ſuch an order, he would haue cauſed the Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no leſſe to haue driuen them out, then the Catechumens, the poſſeſſed of Spirites, or the penitentes. But this oddes there was, that they only were of neceſsitie driuen out of the Church, who though they would, might not communicate: But the reſte that might communicate, did, and might tarie, albeit they would not communicate.</p>
                  <p>Now a wiſe man (as M. Iewel taketh him ſelfe to be) would vnderſtand, that how earneſtly ſoeuer S. Cryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom ſpeaketh, to prouoke thoſe that were preſent, to communicate: yet his meaning was not to burden them with any mortal ſinne for ſtanding by without receiuing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. His wordes therfore import a counſel ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:12789:369"/> then a precept. And verely of the two, it were leſſe euil to ſtand by, and not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, then neither to communicate, nor to ſtand by. Neither is the ſtanding by that, which chiefly S. Chryſoſtome reproued, but the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteining from the Communion. And there is no doubt, but if (whereas none at al by his owne wordes did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time communicate) S. Chryſoſtom had ſeene euery one go out of the Churche, and him ſelfe leafte alone: he would then as faſt haue called them in againe, bidding them at the leſt, to honour the Sacrifice with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, if they would not ſacramentally communicate.</p>

It is to be vnderſtanded, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of Leo, and in his time alſo, the manner and cuſtom was, that the faithful people receiued either one, or bothe kindes, as their deuotion ſerued them.

They then perceiuing, that at the myſteries ſome Chriſtians vſed to receiue one kind alone, mingled them ſelues alwaies with them, and wholy abſteined from the Chalice.

They receiue with vnworthy mouthe the body of Chriſte, but as for the bloud of our redemption, they
<pb facs="tcp:12789:374"/> vtterly refuſe to receiue it.</p>
                  <p>Now if theſe men came thus to the myſteries among the Chriſtians to hide their hereſie, and infidelitie: it is not to be thought, that they alone receiued one kinde.

                  <p>This bread is bread, before the wordes of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: when Conſecration commeth to it, of breade is made the fleſh of Chriſt. Let vs confirme this.

For as for al the reſt, that is there ſaid, praiſe is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to God praier for the people is ſent before, for kings, and for al other. When the Prieſt commeth to make this honourable Sacrament, he vſeth not now his owne wordes, but the wordes of our Lord. The worde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Chriſt maketh this Sacrament. What worde of Chriſt? Verely that wherwith al things were made. Our Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, and heauen was made.

And bicauſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired M. Iewel to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrue S. Ambroſes wordes, which yet he would not do, though he promiſed to do it: I wil conſtrue them for him, and wil ſhewe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme blindneſſe, or rather his wilfulneſſe in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that ſentence. <hi>Ergo,</hi> then, <hi>ſi tanta vis eſt,</hi> if ſo great ſtrength be, <hi>in ſermone Domini Ieſu,</hi> in the ſpeach of our Lord Ieſus, <hi>vt,</hi> that, <hi>quae non erant,</hi> the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which were not, <hi>inciperent eſſe,</hi> beganne to be, that is to ſaie, to haue a being: <hi>quantò magis operatorius eſt,</hi> how much more is our Lordes ſpeach workful, <hi>vt,</hi> that, <hi>quae erant,</hi> the thinges which were, <hi>ſint,</hi> be, that is to ſaie, haue a being, <hi>&amp; in aliud commutentur,</hi> and be changed, into an other thing? By theſe wordes it is cleere, that S. Ambroſe here ſpeaketh generally of al thinges, whiche God worketh by his word, and not particularly of bread, and wine.</p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:12789:377"/>
                  <p>Now wil I conſtrue the ſame woordes, as M. Iewel would haue them to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Firſt, he vnderſtandeth, and ſupplieth, <hi>bread and wine,</hi> to be the nominatiue caſe to the verbe, <hi>ſint,</hi> be, or rather to the verbe, <hi>Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> as for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage he altereth that holy Doctours wordes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is euident, that in the ſame whole ſentence, <hi>breade, and wine</hi> are not particularly once named.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he beginneth the conſtruction with the verbe <hi>(ſint)</hi> whereas <hi>(quae erant)</hi> ſhould go before it, as it may wel appeare by ſetting the one part of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon againſt the other. For the one part is thus to be ſet, <hi>Quae non erant incipiunt eſſe,</hi> the thinges which were not, beginne to be. Therefore the other muſt be thus ſet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: <hi>quae erant, ſunt, &amp; in aliud commutantur.</hi> The thinges whiche were, be, and be changed into an other thing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, betwen <hi>quae,</hi> and <hi>erant,</hi> M. Iewel conueieth in a pronowne demonſtratiue, which hath no place there, ſaying, <hi>which (they)</hi> were, as if bread, and wine were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. Againe, you tranſlate, <hi>Sunt, quae erant,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine the ſame, that they were. And thoſe wordes you put forth in great texte letters. Is <hi>Sunt,</hi> to be engliſhed, <hi>They remaine the ſame? Sunt,</hi> is no more, <hi>but They be.</hi> If S. Ambroſe would haue ſaid, as you vntruly tranſlate him, his wordes had benne theſe, <hi>manent eadem:</hi> for that is the Latine of this your Engliſh, <hi>they remaine the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But S. Ambroſe meaneth thus. Thoſe thinges that were not, by Gods word beginne to be: And thoſe that were, by Gods word be alſo, but they be another thing. How ſo? Bicauſe they are changed into an other thing. But M. Iewel beginning the conſtruction amiſſe, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb facs="tcp:12789:378"/> vs, that Gods worde cauſeth things to be, that they were, whiche is not S. Ambroſes minde. For then Gods worde ſhould cauſe bread to be bread ſtil, and that were onely the conſeruing of creatures, and not a changing of creatures. But now al S. Ambroſes reaſon procedeth to proue, that Gods worde is of force to change creatures, and he meaneth of change in ſubſtance. For al his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon conſiſteth about the wordes, <hi>non eſſe, &amp; eſſe,</hi> and, <hi>eſſe, &amp; aliud eſſe.</hi> Things that were not, be, and thoſe that be already, become to be an other thing. If they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to be onely an other thing in qualitie, then they are onely already a thing in qualitie, whiche is falſe. For the being that they haue, is a certaine ſubſtance or ſubſtanciall being. Therefore the other being, or change, which they haue, is an other ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>And I praye you, who would not woonder to ſee S. Ambroſe labour ſo vehemently to prooue, that Gods worde is able to chaunge a creature in qualitie, as though a man were not hable to change a thing in qualitie? Can not the Cutler make ruſtie iron bright? Can not a Pargeter make a browne wal white? Can not a Cooke make colde liquour hote? And can not you M. Iewel ſhew your ſelfe ſometimes ſweet, and quiet, ſometimes eager, and waſpiſh, ſometimes a true man, more often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a lyer? Wherin ſtandeth this great force and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods woorde, whereof S Ambroſe ſpeaketh? Soothly in the change of the ſubſtance of thinges. For as he beganne his diſputation, before the wordes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, quod he, the bread, is bread: but when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is come vnto it, <hi>de pane,</hi> from of bread it is made Chriſtes fleſh. Marke, whence is the change made, from
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:12789:378"/> bread. And into what is it made? Into fleſh. This then is that S. Ambroſe muſt proue, That Gods word hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to change bread into fleſh.</p>
                  <p>To make ſhort, this very ſentence, whereof we nowe diſpute, is in an other place thus vttered by S. Ambroſe. <hi>Sermo Chriſti, qui potuit ex nihilo facere quod non erat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De ijs qui initiantur myſterijs. cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>non poteſt ea quae ſunt, in id mutare quod no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erant?</hi> The worde of Chriſt, which could make that, which was not, of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, can it not change thoſe things which be, into that which they were not? He geueth an euident reaſon of his owne wordes, ſaying: <hi>Non enim minus est nouas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, dare, quàm mutare naturas.</hi> For it is not leſſe, to geue new natures vnto things, then to change natures. As who ſhould ſay, he that can geue new natures, can much more change natures. Now ſir, I pray you, when God geueth new natures, doth he not geue new ſubſtances? When therefore he is ſaid at the ſame time to worke in changing natures, it is meant that he changeth ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to wit, bread into the bodie of Chriſt, and wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bloud. You haue a giltie conſcience M. Iewel, if al this conſidered, yet you wil hold your owne, and ſay ſtil, that S. Ambroſe meant not a change in ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but only in qualitie. For either you haue loſt your wit, or els you doo ſee, to what purpoſe S. Ambroſes diſcourſe goeth.</p>
                  <p>Beſides al this, conſider good Reader, howe S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe concludeth, and endeth this diſcourſe: <hi>Ergo didici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti, quòd ex pane corpus fiat Chriſti.</hi> Nowe then thou haſt learned, that of bread the body of Chriſt is made. His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then was to ſhewe, not that a newe qualitie, but that a newe ſubſtance was made by change of the olde ſubſtance: Of breade (I ſaye) the Bodie of Chriſte
<pb facs="tcp:12789:379"/> was made, and of wine was made his bloud. And yet it appeareth not bloud,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>vt nullus horror cruoris ſit,</hi> that there might be no abhorring of bloude. But as in deede our ſinnes are vtterly taken away in Baptiſme, where the olde Adam dieth, and a newe creature is made in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes: euen ſo although it appeare not bloud, yet in deede the olde ſubſtance of the wine is changed into the new ſubſtance of the bloud of our Sauiour. Thus the bread, and wine are changed in ſubſtance, and yet kepe ſtil their olde outward formes.</p>

If your ſkil in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique were anſwerable to your boaſting, you ſhould ſee the difference betwen change of accidentes, and change of Subſtances, whereof you ſeeme ignorant. Howbeit, I ſaid not the bread is changed, <hi>Ergo,</hi> bread remaineth ſtil: it is you, that ſaie ſo. I ſaid the bread is changed into another thing. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is. But I ſaie not, that it is bread, but that it is that, into which it is changed. And therfore it hath a being, though it haue not the ſame being in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which it had before conſecration.

He ſaith, that bloude (of the olde Teſtament) hath geuen place to the cuppe, not conſidering, that he nowe alſo receiueth bloude in the Cuppe.</p>
                  <p>Marke Reader this compariſon of S. Auguſtine, that, as the olde Fathers did eate of the Lambe, ſo do we of the true Lambe Chriſte: and as the Prieſtes of the Law had bloud in their baſens, euen ſo haue we in our cuppe, whence we receiue it. The oddes onely is, that their bloude was onely the bloude of Calues, not hable to cleanſe man, but our bloude is the bloude of Chriſte, which cleanſeth al ſinnes. Our Sacramentes therefore are the ſpiritual noueltie of the new Teſtament, not lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king either Aulter, or Fire, or Breade, or Lambe, or Bloude, but hauing them al in Chriſtes Body, and Bloud, into which the breade, and wine are ſo conuerted, that the verey true and real bloude of Chriſte is receiued in
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:12789:382"/> the cuppe.</p>

If then it be cleere by Chriſtes owne wordes, and by the interpretation of the Fahers, that the ſame bloude, which was ſhed for vs, and which ranne out of Chriſtes ſide, was in the cuppe, and that thence it is partaken, ſeing that wine was not ſhed for our redemption: it is cleere, that after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration wine was not in Chriſtes cuppe, except (as I ſaid before) we take wine by a metaphore, as Chriſt is the vine, and his bloud is the wine of that vine which Chriſt is.</p>

And yet thoſe two helpes ſo far vnlike, are put together in one ſentence, and expreſſed by one kinde of ſpeache. But it is not a phraſe of ſpeache, whiche maketh the difference, it is the harte of the faithful, which diſtinguiſheth al. Your wordes be faire M.

It is that fowle, and blind harte of yours, that ſhal condemne you, and not letters, or ſyllables, whiche in al your bookes you hunt after. Whatſoeuer our wordes be, you maie aſſure your ſelfe, our faith, and harte putteth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference inough betwen S. Thomas Becket a good man, and Chriſt Ieſus God, and man.

And by this, for ſo muche as ſeemeth to mee, in that righteouſneſſe, whiche is to be perfourmed, he hath profited muche in this life, who in profiting knoweth, how farre he is from the perfection of righteouſnes. But there maie be named an other leſſer Righteouſnes competent for this life, in
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:12789:395"/> which the righteous man liueth of faith, although he be as yet a forreiner (or Pilgrime) from our Lord:<note place="margin">A leſſer righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for this preſent life.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whiles he walketh by faith and not as yet by ſight, it is not abſurde to ſaie of him, that he belongeth to this (leſſer righteouſnes) that he ſinne not. For if there can not yet in this life be ſo great a loue of God, as is dewe vnto that ful, and perfite knowledge, it is not to be imputed vnto vs for a fault. For it is one thing, not to attaine as yet the whole Charitie, and an other thing, to follow no luſt.<note place="margin">Hovv the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of louing God vvith al our po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vver, is fulfilled in this life.</note>

                  <p>By theſe wordes we learne, firſt, that the precepte of louing God with al our power, is after one ſort fulfilled in this life, if doing what we can, we beleue, and hope, as we ought, that wee ſhal loue God with al our power in the other life.

And that there is a ſecond perfection, whiche ſtandeth with our frailtie:<note place="margin">A diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vvherby al M.

By this double perfection al is anſwered, what ſo euer M. Iewel bringeth againſt vs, either out of the Scriptures, or out of the Fathers. It is poſsible to doo the law in this life, after that perfection, which belongeth to Pilgrimes, but not after that, which belongeth to Heauen. But the Pelagians held, that a man
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:12789:396"/> might if he would, perfourme the perfection, and that by the benefites of nature, and by free wil without grace.</p>
                  <p>If a man conſider the doctrine whiche we haue taught hitherto concerning Perfection, it ſhal appeare, that many thinges, which M. Iewel hath alleged in the Defence, are of vs confeſſed. Whereof then riſeth the difference? verely of the wordes of the Apologie,<note place="margin">In the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie. Defence, pag. 315.</note> which are theſe. <hi>Wee are hable by no meanes to fulfil the lawe of God in this life.</hi> This propoſition M. Iewel I haue confuted. This haue you taken in hande to defende. But in al your Defence I finde nothing to that purpoſe. I haue now ſhewed,<note place="margin">By vvhat meanes vve fulfil the lavv.</note> that by ſome meanes we may ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the lawe, to wit, by preſent faith, and hope, and by going daily forward in Charitie, vntil we come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Heauen.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore we maie die alſo for Goddes ſake,<note place="margin">The glad ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of death for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſake, is one meane to fulfil Godslaw. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; vlt.</hi>
                     </note> and for the defence of his truth. This is one meane, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the lawe is fulfilled. Therefore your Propoſition remaineth ſtil giltie of erroneus doctrine. Beſides this, it is not impoſsible for a man actually to fulfil the lawe in this life: bicauſe God may geue a man ſo muche grace as to doo it, if it pleaſe him, as S. Auguſtine hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red twiſe in his booke <hi>De ſpiritu &amp; litera.</hi> Therefore by ſome meanes we may be able to fulfil the lawe, and that perfitely, although I confeſſe, we doo not fulfil it. But remember, you ſaid not onely we do not fulfil the law, but that wee are not hable to fulfil it by no meanes. Whereby you abbridge the power of God. For Gods ſingular grace, is a meane to perfourme it. S. Hierome alſo graunted to Pelagius, <hi>poſsibilia mandata dedit Deus,</hi>

The firſt kinde of knowledge, is bare, and naked Faith. The ſecond, is Faith furniſhed, and clothed with Charitie.

He can not be iudge of Biſhoppes and Prieſtes, nor cal them to his ſeate of Iudgement in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, and maters of Faithe that is vnequal in office, or vnlike in right and authoritie. But the Prince is vnequal to the Biſhop in office, and vnlike vnto him in right and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: (For he hath no right nor authoritie to ſacrifice, to preache, to binde, to looſe, to excommunicate, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Sacramentes) Therefore the Prince can not be iudge of Biſhoppes, and Prieſtes, nor cal them to his ſeate of Iudgement in any eccleſiaſtical cauſe, or mater of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Againe, no man hath authoritie ouer his ſuperiour: But the Biſhop, in maters of Faithe, and Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, is ſuperiour to euery Prince: Therefore in thoſe cauſes the Prince hath no authoritie ouer the Biſhop.

<pb facs="tcp:12789:411"/> as to popelike, according to your interpretation. But if either the Gloſer had conſidered the reaſon that moued the Pope, or you, that followe the Gloſe, would haue marked the litle cauſe, that ſtandeth by the Gloſe in the margent in the laſt printe of Paris, where it is ſaid, <hi>hoc totum ideo fuit, vt fama eius clarior appareret:</hi> al this was done (by the wiſedom of S.

If you make this obiection, we anſwer, that if the wordes were exactely ſifted by the true and grammatical conſtruction, you would hardly maineteine this interpretation. But I wil not contende about wordes. Let it be, as you would haue it. Let Brunichildis haue a commiſsion from the Pope to ſee, that Biſhop Menna made his purgation before her. Your purpoſe and ſaying is nothing proued by it. For firſt you ſaie, <hi>The Pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a ſpiritual mater in a cauſe of Simonie to be heard, and ended by a woman.</hi> And this is a vaine tale, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true fanſie of yours, not hable to be gathered by any worde of that decree. For the cauſe of Simonie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Menna was accuſed, was heard, and ended by the Pope, and he not founde faultie in it, was abſolued, and ſent home. And a cauſe once heard, and determined by the Pope, is not wonte to be committed afterward to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:12789:411"/> the hearing, and determination of a woman.</p>
                  <p>After this, as though this lie had not ben lowde ynough, you tel vs, that <hi>Brunichildis being a woman, by vertue of the Popes commiſsion, ſummoned a Biſhop to appeare, and ſolemnely to make his purgation before her:</hi> and for your credite you referre vs in the margent to Gratian. 2. q. 5. <hi>Mennam.</hi>

                  <p>By theſe, as alſo by the purporte of ſundrie other Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinians conſtitutions, ordinances, and decrees, al menne maie ſee, that he neither chalenged any ſupreme domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer Biſhops, and Prieſtes in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, nor enacted this, nor any other lawe, as chiefe Gouernour of the Churche, but followed the holy Councels, and willed the Canons to take place, and confirmed that, which was decreed by them.</p>
                  <p>For ſpecial anſwer then to this ſpecial obiection made out of the 123, conſtitution, I ſaie that Iuſtinian threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to pouniſhe them with the ſeueritie of temporal lawes, who would not be conteined in their duetie by Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, and order of the Canons, that feare might force, where loue and conſcience could not binde. Which policie we doo not miſlike, ſeing <hi>(Duo vincula fortius ligant)</hi> two bondes binde faſter then one.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhorte, Iuſtinian leaueth the correction of
<pb facs="tcp:12789:414"/> Clerkes offending in any thing againſt the Canons, to the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſures of the Canons. And if any refuſe to abide the order appointed by the Canons, and vtterly ſhake of the yoke of the Canons: then, that is to ſay, in the caſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſtubborneſſe, and contempte of the Canons, like a Godly prince, he threateneth reuenge, and pouniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>So neither by the lawes of Iuſtinian, neither by the example of Brunichildis, neither by the Gloſes, that you ſo ſolemnely allege, it can not be ſeene, that Godly Princes might euer ſummone Biſhops to appeare before them, to receiue any pouniſhment at their handes, as their ſuperiours and ſupreme gouernours in eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cauſes.

Or if M.

                  <p>As for the place whiche you bring out of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, you brought it before in your Replie, to proue, that Emperours might receiue Appeales in eccleſiaſtical cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.<note place="margin">

You promiſed to tel vs of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, that ſubmitted them ſelues, and made their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations before kinges and Emperours, and beginning with that good Pope, you forgette your ſelfe, and for making of a purgation, you tel vs of making ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. Whereby we gather, that either you paſſe not what you ſaie, or remember not what ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Liberius dealing with Conſtantius the Arian Emperour at that appearance, was ſuche, as became a Biſhoppe of the Apoſtolike See. For in that cauſe he would neither be ouerborne by the authoritie of the Emperour, nor yelde vnto his wickedneſſe againſt Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius for a longe time, muche leſſe acknowledge him for his ſuperiour, or iudge.</p>
                  <p>As for Pope Sixtus, it is certaine, that he made his purgation before the Emperour Valentinian. But he did it M. Iewel <hi>in Concilio,</hi> in a Councel of Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes, and not in a courte of the Prince. And he did it of humilitie to auoide the ſuſpicion, and malice of his aduerſaries, and not to geue any Preſident to others to doo the like, nor to preiudicate the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:12789:417"/> of the Apoſtolique See. Theſe are his wordes in the place, that your ſelfe allege. <hi>Vnderſtande ye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> q. <hi>4.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>daſtis. Noſtra authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</note> 
                     <hi>that I am falſely accuſed of one Baſſus, and vniuſtly perſecuted. Whiche the Emperour Valentinian hearing, commaunded a Synode by vertue of our authoritie to be aſſembled. When the Synode was aſſembled, I ſatiſfying al with great exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, albeit I might otherwiſe haue eſcaped, yet auoiding ſuſpicion, I made my purgation before them al, diſcharging thereby my ſelfe from ſuſpicion, and from emulation and enuie, Sed non alijs, qui hoc noluerint, aut non ſponte ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerint, faciendi formam dans,</hi> But not geuing a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to others to doo the like, that either ſhal not be willing, or wil not voluntarily chooſe this kinde of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                  <p>Lo M. Iewel, your owne authour condemneth you. Pope Sixtus made his purgation, not onely before Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian, but, <hi>coram omnibus,</hi> before al Biſhoppes, and others aſſembled in the Synode. And he did it not by compulſion of any ſuperiour Authoritie, but of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, to declare his innocencie, and not to geue any other a preſident to doo the like. And by this ye maie perceiue, that the Emperour had of him ſelfe nor autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to cal that Councel, nor power to ſummone the Pope to his Iudgement Seate, nor any iuriſdiction to force him to make his Purgation before his Maieſtie. For al was done by the ſubmiſsion of the Pope. He conſented to the Emperours calling of that Councel: he gaue him licence to heare his purgation, and to be iudge in that cauſe. And he that geueth an other authoritie and commiſsion, is by natural reaſon higher: and
<pb facs="tcp:12789:418"/> of greater power in that caſe, then he that receiueth the authoritie, and commiſsion. Wherefore Pope Sixtus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his purgation before the Emperour Valentinian, can not be ſaid to haue benne conuented before a laie Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as his ſuperiour, and lawful iudge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Leo 3. and Leo 4.</note>Concerning Leo the thirde, and Leo the fourth, their caſe is like. When they made their Purgation, the one ſaid euen in the place, that you allege: <hi>hoc faciens, non legem praſcribo caeteris,</hi>

                     </note> doing this, I doo not preſcribe a lawe to force other menne to doo the like. The other gaue the Emperour licence to appointe Commiſsioners, to heare his cauſe, and ſubmitted him ſelfe to their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore we ſaie the Emperour was not their iudge, nor ſuperiour by any princely authoritie, but by theſe Popes permiſsion, and appointement.</p>
                  <p>As for Pope Iohn the 22. (of whoſe errour you make muche a doo in ſo many places of your bookes) I haue ſaid ſufficiently before, in the Anſwer to your View of your Vntruthes. <hi>Fol. 64. &amp; ſequent.</hi> Where I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how falſly you belie him, and wherein he erred touching the ſtate of the Soules of the iuſt after this life.

There was neuer Diuine, that ſerued him ſelfe with the ſtuffe of the Gloſe, ſo muche as you doo. What inferre you vpon it?

                  <p>This ſad and graue ſaying you could not wel brooke. It liked you better therfore to purle in the Gloſe.

Hierome, <hi>we ſhould thinke any il, or ſiniſtre thing of them, that with their holy mouthe conſecrate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes bodie.</hi> Tpon this worde, <hi>Siniſtrum,</hi> the Gloſe ſaith. <hi>Hoc eſt verum in ijs quae poſſunt trahi ad bonum, &amp; ad malu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vbi ſemper in meliorem partem eſt interpretandum. Si ergo Clericus amplectitur mulierem, interpretabitur (Canon) quòd cauſa benedicendi eam hoc faciat.</hi> This is true in thoſe thinges that maie be drawen to good, and to euil, where alwaies we muſt interprete (that whiche is done) in the better parte. Therfore if a Clerke imbrace a woman (or laie his armes ouer her) this Canon wil interprete it, that he doth it to bleſſe her. Theſe wordes, <hi>a laie man muſt iudge of it thus,</hi> be your owne wordes, the Gloſes
<pb facs="tcp:12789:429"/> worde, <hi>interpretabitur,</hi> doth not ſo ſignifie. Neither is it to be vnderſtanded of the ſecrete iudgement, whiche a man conceiueth in his owne harte to him ſelfe, of ſuche a deede beholden with his eies, but of the interpretation made of it to others, for ſo doth <hi>interpretari</hi> ſignifie. This then is the ſenſe of that Gloſe. If a clerke or a Prieſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a woman, for ſo muche as it maie be drawen to good, that is to ſaie, it maie in a caſe be done to good purpoſe, as to bleſſe her, to praie ouer her, or to doo the courteſie of ſalutation according to the manner in ſome countries: the Canon wil interpret it, that is to ſaie, if we folow the minde and deuotion of S. Hierome, whoſe wordes that Canon conteineth, we ſhal (he ſaith not iudge) but interprete it, as done to thintent to bleſſe her. Why I make <hi>Canon</hi> nominatiue caſe to the verbe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretabitur,</hi> it is not to be marueled at, for ſo the Gloſe it ſelfe teacheth me, where immediatly it foloweth, <hi>tamen quandoque Canon ſolam confabulationem interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in deteriorem partem.</hi> Yet ſometime the Canon doth interprete the onely talking (with a woman) in the worſe parte.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhorte, if a Prieſt maie embrace any woman with honeſt, and good intent, if it be not of it ſelfe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnhoneſt, and vnlawful: when he is ſene ſo to doo, by the godly Counſel of this Canon, which is the faying of S. Hierome, and by the expoſition of the Gloſe, the facte is to be taken and interpreted, not in the worſe, but in the better part, for ſo the order of charitie requireth, and ſo ſpecially the honour of the Apoſtolike Degree, whereunto Prieſtes be admitted in making or conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the pretious body of Chriſte, requireth. Now as
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:12789:429"/> the ſinne of a Prieſt is more hainous then the ſame ſinne in a laie man, ſo when he doth a thing that maie be both wel, and euil done, for the reuerence, and honour of that high and holy order, it is to be reported with the better interpretation. And thus that Gloſe maketh nothing for defence of Fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwen ſingle folke, for proufe whereof, to the reproufe of the Canoniſtes it is by you alleged.

If of your ſelfe, then, <hi>maius peccatum habes,</hi> if of any other, then bring him forth a Goddes name, to diſcharge your ſelfe of malice, albeit not of folie.</p>
                  <p>I do gheſſe, that you wil peraduenture bring forth a greate Stoareman of yours, who furniſheth you with ſuche gaie ſtuffe, and maketh you a greate Truant, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe meete for the purpoſe, that wil neuer faile ſuche a
<pb facs="tcp:12789:440"/> falſe merchant at a neede. I take him to be that ſures bee of yours, Matthias Flacius Illyricus. For you declare your ſelfe, that you, beſide other bookes of his, haue benne buſie with his <hi>Norma Concilij Tridentini.</hi> And there I finde written:<note place="margin">In altera parte cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturae. pa. <hi>541.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Nicolai Cuſani, poſt quam factus eſt Cardinalis, ſententia, de auctoritate Eccleſiae, &amp; Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lij ſupra, &amp; contra Scriptutam.</hi> But yet this wil not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge you of malice. For he ſaith not, that he enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled his booke ſo, as you doo affirme, but doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to recite Cuſanes minde of that matter, as this worde, <hi>Sententia,</hi> declareth. Now one maie gather an other mannes minde concerning any matter out of his writinges, though he neuer made any worke of that title.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth Illyricus ſpecifie in that place the worke out of the which he hath drawen that, whiche he there allegeth, and whiche you receiued of him againe at the ſeconde hande. So that I can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, but that the blame bothe of folie, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice muſt reſte ſtil vpon your owne perſone. For I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you wil not haue your ſelfe taken for ſo ignorant, as to thinke <hi>Sententia</hi> is latine for a booke: or if you wil, then why doo you ſo bragge, as it were, and boaſt of your great reading and learning?</p>
                  <p>Moreouer you haue not onely geuen vs a falſe title of your owne imagination to Cuſanus writinge, but alſo of an Epiſtle you haue made a Booke. That your good intente and plaine dealing herein maye be more euident, I wil recite the title of thal Epiſtle, as it is to be founde amonge his workes printed at Baſile <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:12789:440"/> 1565. Pagin. 851. 852. Epiſtola 7. Nicolai de Cuſa Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalis ad Clerum, &amp; Literatos Bohemiae,</hi> and thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in the toppe of the leafe is added, <hi>De amplecten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da vnitate Eccleſiae.</hi> Let bothe theſe Titles be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and your malicious intent in ſo wilfully depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the authours wordes, to bring him out of credite, muſt moſt manifeſtly appeare.</p>
                  <p>Wel, perchaunce you wil ſaye, though the title be altered, yet his wordes out of that ſame Epiſtle be truely recited, wherein conſiſteth the chiefe effecte, and principal purpoſe. If you ſo ſaye, you wil be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no leſſe a Lier, and falſe reporter herein, then you haue benne in the reſte. And for example hereof I wil bringe euen the very firſte place that you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged out of him. You tel vs page. 55. that, <hi>thus he ſaith. Sequuntur Scripturae Eccleſiam, &amp; non è conuerſo:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cuſanus fovvly falſified by M. Ievvel.</note> The Scriptures of God followe the Churche: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the Churche followeth not the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>You haue here clipped the Authours ſentence, and quite altered the ſenſe. His wordes are theſe. <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia igitur, ſicut recipit Scripturam, ita &amp; interpretatur.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 858,</note> 
                     <hi>Sequuntur Scriptura Eccleſiam, quae prior eſt, &amp; propter quam Scripturae, &amp; non è conuerſo:</hi> The Churche, as it receiueth the Scripture, ſo doth it expounde the ſame. The Scriptures therefore do follow the Churche, which is the former, and for the which the Scripture is ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, and not contrariwiſe.</p>
                  <p>What oddes is betwixt this ſentence of Cuſanus, and that whiche you haue fathered vpon him, any meane witted man maie ealſily perceiue. For Cuſanus wordes
<pb facs="tcp:12789:441"/> in their right forme doo bothe ſtande wel, and haue a good meaning. But your falſe changing of them cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to importe an intollerable Derogation to the Scriptures without any colour of truth. For as it is moſt true, that the Church was before the Scriptures (that is to ſaie, the written worde of God) and that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were ordeined and appointed for the Churche, but not contrariwiſe the Churche for the Scriptures: ſo is it very falſe, that the Scriptures doo followe the Church, and the Church not the Scriptures. For why hath the Church receiued the Scriptures, but to follow them, and put them in execution both in our inward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe and in our outward actions? Doo you not bluſh M. Iewel thus wilfully to peruerte that with your falſe iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, and conueying awaie of thoſe wordes <hi>quae prior eſt, &amp; propter quam Scripturae,</hi> whiche before had a right good ſenſe? You thought by like, you ſhould neuer heare thereof againe, nor be called to any reckening: or elles you would haue had more regarde ro your good name and honeſtie. You can pretende no tollerable excuſe, as that you had not Cuſanus workes at hande. For euen Illyricus, vpon whoſe credite you haue taken vp al that you haue out of this epiſtle, doth not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reporte the ſame,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>544.</hi> in <hi>2.</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Clauis Script.</note> then they are to be founde in the authour. But you thought you would paſſe him an aſe in falſehood, although he be his craftes maſter therein.</p>
                  <p>How fowly you haue ouerſhote your ſelfe in falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentences, and miſreporting authour for authour, and booke for booke, that which hath hitherto ben decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, maie be ſufficient inſtruction to any man, that is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous to vnderſtande the truthe, and not
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:12789:441"/> content to be lead into wilful blindnes and errour. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit to make the matter a litle more ſenſible and plainer and alſo to geue you occaſion the better to know your folie, and not to exalte your ſelfe ouermuch with pride, vaine glorie, and preſumption, of I can not tel what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie knowledge, as you ſeeme to doo: I wil ſet before your eyes ſuch a glaſſe of your groſſe ouerſight, ignorance, and blindnes to looke in, as you may, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture wil be aſhamed thereof, if you be not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſt ſhame already. Many times either to hide your ignorance, or to weary the ſearcher, or to couer your falſehood, you bring vs in ſuch general quotations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number of Booke, or Chapter, as a man ſhal be litle the nearer. For examples whereof, Pag. 15. 158. 265. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. Pag. 51 August. de Ciuitate Dei. Pag. 50. 267. Cyprianus Pag. 37. Euſebius. Pag. 29. Theodorit. in Hiſtor. Eccleſiaſt. Pa.</hi> 11. <hi>Theodorit. de curand. Graec. affect. Pag. 482. 532. Baldus. pa. 486. Eckius. Pag. 564. Hieronymus. 629. Fortalitium fidei. Ite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 401. 313.

                  <p>In al theſe and ſuch like places, a man hath occaſion iuſtly to ſuſpect your couert dealing: that either the place maketh nothing for your purpoſe, if it were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, or that there be no ſuch wordes there at al, or at the leaſt, that you doo not ſpeake of certain knowledge, but by ſome gheſſe, or vpon an other mannes reporte. But where you are ſo bold, as to quote vnto vs the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters, there it were to be ſuppoſed that you ſhoulde ſpeake <hi>ex ſpeciali ſcientia,</hi> of your preciſe knowledge, and ſo muche the more, as you ofte inculcate one place.
<pb facs="tcp:12789:442"/> And yet for al that it is to be proued, that euen in ſuche places you doo but ſet a great looke on the matter, to outface your readers, and gaineſaiers withal. Example moſt notable hereof is to be taken of your quotations of one <hi>Heruaeus de Poteſtate Papae,</hi> a greate and familiar Doctour with you. About 37. times, and euery where (ſauing in two places, that is to wit <hi>Pag.</hi> 331. 608.) you haue quoted vnto vs preciſely the Chapter, and yet he hath not diuided his booke into any Chapters at al. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by like you had a good ſight, that could ſo often ſee ſo many, and diſtincte Chapters, where there be none. Yea whiche is more, that you could recite ſo many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences out of him, and ſome of them not without loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe oftentimes repeated, and yet neuer a one of them to be founde in ſuch forme of wordes in al the booke. This maie ſeme a very ſtrange matter vnto them, who tooke you to be the chiefe Doctour, and the moſt precious Iewel of al our Miniſters of this Engliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. And therefore they wil ſurmiſe, that I ſpeake this in a dreame of you. But that they maie knowe I ſpeake not of reporte, but by trial and experience, I wil here ſet out before the Readers eyes the Pages, where <hi>Heruaeus</hi> is quoted in the margent of your booke, that if he can come by the booke, whiche is in deede of an olde printe, he maie by conference proue, whether I haue ſaid herein otherwiſe then truthe.</p>

               <p>GOod Reader, I haue here ſet before thee a briefe Note, or Table of certaine places, of purpoſe, and guilefully leafte out by M. Iewel in his recital of the texte of my Confutation, printed in the booke of his Defence, whiche places in making this Detection I had occaſion to expreſſe. By the ſame thou maiſt ſee, and as in a fewe haue a taſte (for to note al it woulde amounte to a iuſte volume) how he deceiueth thee in the reſte, bearing the countenance of one, that hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſubſtance of the whole Confutation. For ſo much he telleth thee him ſelfe with theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To anſvver</hi> M. <hi>Hardinge to euery parcel of his Booke, being ſo long, it vvould be tedious.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Ievvel in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his De, fence. Pag. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>VVherefore leauing many his impertinent ſpeaches, and vnneceſſarie and vvaſte vvordes, I vvil touche onely ſo muche thereof, as ſhal beare ſome ſhevve of ſubſtance, and maie any vvaie ſeeme vvorthy to be anſvvered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How wel and truely M. Iewel hath kepte this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and how at the firſt greeting, and entrie of his Booke he begileth thee, by theſe fewe places here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in this Detection at large ſet forth, thou ſhalt ſee and perceiue. For trial therefore of his truthe, haue recourſe vnto the leaues of this Booke here quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and looke what places of the Texte of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation there recited, be comprehended within two ſtarres (as I doo alſo there in the Margent warne thee) aſſure thy ſelfe, that al thoſe, and an infinite number of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:12789:443"/> ſuche other places, are by M. Iewel in this his Defence quite leafte out, as if no ſuch thing had ben written. And then whether ſuch places by him ſo leafte out, <hi>be but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent ſpeaches, and vnneceſſarie and waſte wordes,</hi> or right worthy to be anſwered, I leaue it to thine owne indifferent iudgement to diſcerne.
